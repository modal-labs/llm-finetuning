{"text": "\n# Finetuning Flan-T5\nExample by [@anishpdalal](https://github.com/anishpdalal)\n[Flan-T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5) is a highly versatile model that's been instruction-tuned to\nperform well on a variety of text-based tasks such as question answering and summarization. There are smaller model variants available which makes\nFlan-T5 a great base model to use for finetuning on a specific instruction dataset with just a single GPU. In this example, we'll\nfinetune Flan-T5 on the [Extreme Sum (\"XSum\")](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xsum) dataset to summarize news articles.\n## Defining dependencies\nThe example uses the `dataset` package from HuggingFace to load the xsum dataset. It also uses the `transformers`\nand `accelerate` packages with a PyTorch backend to finetune and serve the model. Finally, we also\ninstall `tensorboard` and serve it via a web app. All packages are installed into a Debian Slim base image\nusing the `pip_install` function.\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport modal\nfrom modal import Image, Stub, Volume, method, wsgi_app\nVOL_MOUNT_PATH = Path(\"/vol\")\n```\nOther Flan-T5 models can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5)\n```python\nBASE_MODEL = \"google/flan-t5-base\"\nimage = Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\n    \"accelerate\",\n    \"transformers\",\n    \"torch\",\n    \"datasets\",\n    \"tensorboard\",\n)\nstub = Stub(name=\"example-news-summarizer\", image=image)\noutput_vol = Volume.persisted(\"finetune-volume\")\nstub.volume = output_vol\n```\n### Handling preemption\nAs this finetuning job is long-running it's possible that it experiences a preemption.\nThe training code is robust to pre-emption events by periodically saving checkpoints and restoring\nfrom checkpoint on restart. But it's also helpful to observe in logs when a preemption restart has occurred,\nso we track restarts with a `modal.Dict`.\nSee the [guide on preemptions](/docs/guide/preemption#preemption) for more details on preemption handling.\n```python\nstub.restart_tracker_dict = modal.Dict.new()\ndef track_restarts(restart_tracker: modal.Dict):\n    if not restart_tracker.contains(\"count\"):\n        preemption_count = 0\n        print(f\"Starting first time. {preemption_count=}\")\n        restart_tracker[\"count\"] = preemption_count = 0\n    else:\n        preemption_count = restart_tracker.get(\"count\") + 1\n        print(f\"Restarting after pre-emption. {preemption_count=}\")\n        restart_tracker[\"count\"] = preemption_count\n```\n## Finetuning Flan-T5 on XSum dataset\nEach row in the dataset has a `document` (input news article) and `summary` column.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    gpu=\"A10g\",\n    timeout=7200,\n    volumes={VOL_MOUNT_PATH: output_vol},\n)\ndef finetune(num_train_epochs: int = 1, size_percentage: int = 10):\n    from datasets import load_dataset\n    from transformers import (\n        AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM,\n        AutoTokenizer,\n        DataCollatorForSeq2Seq,\n        Seq2SeqTrainer,\n        Seq2SeqTrainingArguments,\n        TrainerCallback,\n    )\n    track_restarts(stub.restart_tracker_dict)\n    # Use size percentage to retrieve subset of the dataset to iterate faster\n    if size_percentage:\n        xsum_train = load_dataset(\"xsum\", split=f\"train[:{size_percentage}%]\")\n        xsum_test = load_dataset(\"xsum\", split=f\"test[:{size_percentage}%]\")\n    # Load the whole dataset\n    else:\n        xsum = load_dataset(\"xsum\")\n        xsum_train = xsum[\"train\"]\n        xsum_test = xsum[\"test\"]\n    # Load the tokenizer and model\n    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(BASE_MODEL)\n    model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(BASE_MODEL)\n    # Replace all padding tokens with a large negative number so that the loss function ignores them in\n    # its calculation\n    padding_token_id = -100\n    batch_size = 8\n    def preprocess(batch):\n        # prepend summarize: prefix to document to convert the example to a summarization instruction\n        inputs = [\"summarize: \" + doc for doc in batch[\"document\"]]\n        model_inputs = tokenizer(\n            inputs, max_length=512, truncation=True, padding=\"max_length\"\n        )\n        labels = tokenizer(\n            text_target=batch[\"summary\"],\n            max_length=128,\n            truncation=True,\n            padding=\"max_length\",\n        )\n        labels[\"input_ids\"] = [\n            [\n                l if l != tokenizer.pad_token_id else padding_token_id\n                for l in label\n            ]\n            for label in labels[\"input_ids\"]\n        ]\n        model_inputs[\"labels\"] = labels[\"input_ids\"]\n        return model_inputs\n    tokenized_xsum_train = xsum_train.map(\n        preprocess, batched=True, remove_columns=[\"document\", \"summary\", \"id\"]\n    )\n    tokenized_xsum_test = xsum_test.map(\n        preprocess, batched=True, remove_columns=[\"document\", \"summary\", \"id\"]\n    )\n    data_collator = DataCollatorForSeq2Seq(\n        tokenizer,\n        model=model,\n        label_pad_token_id=padding_token_id,\n        pad_to_multiple_of=batch_size,\n    )\n    class CheckpointCallback(TrainerCallback):\n        def __init__(self, volume):\n            self.volume = volume\n        def on_save(self, args, state, control, **kwargs):\n            \"\"\"\n            Event called after a checkpoint save.\n            \"\"\"\n            if state.is_world_process_zero:\n                print(\"running commit on modal.Volume after model checkpoint\")\n                self.volume.commit()\n    training_args = Seq2SeqTrainingArguments(\n        # Save checkpoints to the mounted volume\n        output_dir=str(VOL_MOUNT_PATH / \"model\"),\n        per_device_train_batch_size=batch_size,\n        per_device_eval_batch_size=batch_size,\n        predict_with_generate=True,\n        learning_rate=3e-5,\n        num_train_epochs=num_train_epochs,\n        logging_strategy=\"steps\",\n        logging_steps=100,\n        evaluation_strategy=\"steps\",\n        save_strategy=\"steps\",\n        save_steps=750,\n        save_total_limit=2,\n        load_best_model_at_end=True,\n    )\n    trainer = Seq2SeqTrainer(\n        model=model,\n        args=training_args,\n        callbacks=[CheckpointCallback(stub.volume)],\n        data_collator=data_collator,\n        train_dataset=tokenized_xsum_train,\n        eval_dataset=tokenized_xsum_test,\n    )\n    try:\n        trainer.train(resume_from_checkpoint=True)\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:  # handle possible preemption\n        print(\"received interrupt;

Only a single document is used as the knowledge-base of the application,\nthe 2022 USA State of the Union address by President Joe Biden. However, this same application structure\ncould be extended to do question-answering over all State of the Union speeches, or other large text corpuses.\nIt's the [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) library that makes this all so easy. This demo is only around 100 lines of code!\n## Defining dependencies\nThe example uses three PyPi packages to make scraping easy, and three to build and run the question-answering functionality.\nThese are installed into a Debian Slim base image using the `pip_install` function.\nBecause OpenAI's API is used, we also specify the `openai-secret` Modal Secret, which contains an OpenAI API key.\nA `docsearch` global variable is also declared to facilitate caching a slow operation in the code below.\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom modal import Image, Secret, Stub, web_endpoint\nimage = Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\n    # scraping pkgs\n    \"beautifulsoup4~=4.11.1\",\n    \"httpx~=0.23.3\",\n    \"lxml~=4.9.2\",\n    # langchain pkgs\n    \"faiss-cpu~=1.7.3\",\n    \"langchain~=0.0.138\",\n    \"openai~=0.27.4\",\n    \"tiktoken==0.3.0\",\n)\nstub = Stub(\n    name=\"example-langchain-qanda\",\n    image=image,\n    secrets=[Secret.from_name(\"openai-secret\")],\n)\ndocsearch = None  # embedding index that's relatively expensive to compute, so caching with global var.\n```\n## Scraping the speech from whitehouse.gov\nIt's super easy to scrape the transcipt of Biden's speech using `httpx` and `BeautifulSoup`.\nThis speech is just one document and it's relatively short, but it's enough to demonstrate\nthe question-answering capability of the LLM chain.\n```python\ndef scrape_state_of_the_union() -> str:\n    import httpx\n    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n    url = \"https://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2022/\"\n    # fetch article; simulate desktop browser\n    headers = {\n        \"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_2) AppleWebKit/601.3.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/9.0.2 Safari/601.3.9\"\n    }\n    response = httpx.get(url, headers=headers)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, \"lxml\")\n    # get all text paragraphs & construct string of article text\n    speech_text = \"\"\n    speech_section = soup.find_all(\n        \"div\", {\"class\": \"sotu-annotations__content\"}\n    )\n    if speech_section:\n        paragraph_tags = speech_section[0].find_all(\"p\")\n        speech_text = \"\".join([p.get_text() for p in paragraph_tags])\n    return speech_text.replace(\"\\t\", \"\")\n```\n## Constructing the Q&A chain\nAt a high-level, this LLM chain will be able to answer questions asked about Biden's speech and provide\nreferences to which parts of the speech contain the evidence for given answers.\nThe chain combines a text-embedding index over parts of Biden's speech with OpenAI's [GPT-3 LLM](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/).\nThe index is used to select the most likely relevant parts of the speech given the question, and these\nare used to build a specialized prompt for the OpenAI language model.\nFor more information on this, see [LangChain's \"Question Answering\" notebook](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases/evaluation/question_answering.html).\n```python\ndef retrieve_sources(sources_refs: str, texts: list[str]) -> list[str]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Map back from the references given by the LLM's output to the original text parts.\n    \"\"\"\n    clean_indices = [\n        r.replace(\"-pl\", \"\").strip() for r in sources_refs.split(\",\")\n    ]\n    numeric_indices = (int(r) if r.isnumeric() else None for r in clean_indices)\n    return [\n        texts[i] if i is not None else \"INVALID SOURCE\" for i in numeric_indices\n    ]\ndef qanda_langchain(query: str) -> tuple[str, list[str]]:\n    from langchain.chains.qa_with_sources import load_qa_with_sources_chain\n    from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n    from langchain.llms import OpenAI\n    from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\n    from langchain.vectorstores.faiss import FAISS\n    # Support caching speech text on disk.\n    speech_file_path = Path(\"state-of-the-union.txt\")\n    if speech_file_path.exists():\n        state_of_the_union = speech_file_path.read_text()\n    else:\n        print(\"scraping the 2022 State of the Union speech\")\n        state_of_the_union = scrape_state_of_the_union()\n        speech_file_path.write_text(state_of_the_union)\n    # We cannot send the entire speech to the model because OpenAI's model\n    # has a maximum limit on input tokens.

Here, we choose to use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).\n```python\nweb_app = fastapi.FastAPI()\n```\n## Define endpoints\nWe need two endpoints: one to accept an image and submit it to the Modal job queue,\nand another to poll for the results of the job.\nIn `parse`, we're going to submit tasks to the function defined in the [Job\nQueue tutorial](/docs/guide/ex/doc_ocr_jobs), so we import it first using\n[`Function.lookup`](/docs/reference/modal.Function#lookup).\nWe call [`.spawn()`](/docs/reference/modal.Function#spawn) on the function handle\nwe imported above, to kick off our function without blocking on the results. `spawn` returns\na unique ID for the function call, that we can use later to poll for its result.\n```python\n@web_app.post(\"/parse\")\nasync def parse(request: fastapi.Request):\n    parse_receipt = Function.lookup(\"example-doc-ocr-jobs\", \"parse_receipt\")\n    form = await request.form()\n    receipt = await form[\"receipt\"].read()  # type: ignore\n    call = parse_receipt.spawn(receipt)\n    return {\"call_id\": call.object_id}\n```\n`/result` uses the provided `call_id` to instantiate a `modal.FunctionCall` object, and attempt\nto get its result. If the call hasn't finished yet, we return a `202` status code, which indicates\nthat the server is still working on the job.\n```python\n@web_app.get(\"/result/{call_id}\")\nasync def poll_results(call_id: str):\n    from modal.functions import FunctionCall\n    function_call = FunctionCall.from_id(call_id)\n    try:\n        result = function_call.get(timeout=0)\n    except TimeoutError:\n        return fastapi.responses.JSONResponse(content=\"\", status_code=202)\n    return result\n```\nFinally, we mount the static files for our front-end. We've made [a simple React\napp](https://github.com/modal-labs/modal-examples/tree/main/09_job_queues/doc_ocr_frontend)\nthat hits the two endpoints defined above. To package these files with our app, first\nwe get the local assets path, and then create a modal [`Mount`](/docs/guide/local-data#mounting-directories)\nthat mounts this directory at `/assets` inside our container. Then, we instruct FastAPI to [serve\nthis static file directory](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/static-files/) at our root path.\n```python\nassets_path = Path(__file__).parent / \"doc_ocr_frontend\"\n@stub.function(\n    mounts=[Mount.from_local_dir(assets_path, remote_path=\"/assets\")]\n)\n@asgi_app()\ndef wrapper():\n    web_app.mount(\n        \"/\", fastapi.staticfiles.StaticFiles(directory=\"/assets\", html=True)\n    )\n    return web_app\n```\n## Running\nYou can run this as an ephemeral app, by running the command\n```shell\nmodal serve doc_ocr_webapp.py\n```\n## Deploy\nThat's all! To deploy your application, run\n```shell\nmodal deploy doc_ocr_webapp.py\n```\nIf successful, this will print a URL for your app, that you can navigate to from\nyour browser \ud83c\udf89 .\n![receipt parser processed](./receipt_parser_frontend_2.jpg)\n## Developing\nIf desired, instead of deploying, we can [serve](/docs/guide/webhooks#developing-with-modal-serve)\nour app ephemerally. In this case, Modal watches all the mounted files, and updates\nthe app if anything changes.\n"}
{"text": "\n# Algolia docsearch crawler\nThis tutorial shows you how to use Modal to run the [Algolia docsearch\ncrawler](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/legacy/run-your-own/) to index your\nwebsite and make it searchable. This is not just example code - we run the same\ncode in production to power search on this page (`Ctrl+K` to try it out!).\n## Basic setup\nLet's get the imports out of the way.\n```python\nimport json\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nfrom modal import Image, Secret, Stub, web_endpoint\n```\nModal lets you [use and extend existing Docker images](/docs/guide/custom-container#using-existing-docker-hub-images),\nas long as they have `python` and `pip` available. We'll use the official crawler image built by Algolia, with a small\nadjustment: since this image has `python` symlinked to `python3.6` and Modal is not compatible with Python 3.6, we\ninstall Python 3.8 and symlink that as the `python` executable instead.\n```python\nalgolia_image = Image.from_registry(\n    tag=\"algolia/docsearch-scraper\",\n    setup_dockerfile_commands=[\n        \"RUN apt-get update\",\n        \"RUN apt-get install -y python3.8 python3-distutils wget\",\n        \"RUN wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\",\n        \"RUN python3.8 get-pip.py\",\n        \"RUN ln --symbolic --force --no-dereference /usr/bin/python3.8 /usr/bin/python\",\n        \"ENTRYPOINT []\",\n    ],\n)\nstub = Stub(\"example-algolia-indexer\")\n```\n## Configure the crawler\nNow, let's configure the crawler with the website we want to index, and which\nCSS selectors we want to scrape. Complete documentation for crawler configuration is available\n[here](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/legacy/config-file).\n```python\nCONFIG = {\n    \"index_name\": \"modal_docs\",\n    \"start_urls\": [\n        {\"url\": \"https://modal.com/docs/guide\", \"page_rank\": 5},\n        {\"url\": \"https://modal.com/docs/reference\", \"page_rank\": 1},\n    ],\n    \"selectors\": {\n        \"lvl0\": \"article h1\",\n        \"lvl1\": \"article h1\",\n        \"lvl2\": \"article h2\",\n        \"lvl3\": \"article h3\",\n        \"lvl4\": \"article h4\",\n        \"text\": \"article p,article ol,article ul,article pre\",\n    },\n}\n```\n## Create an API key\nIf you don't already have one, sign up for an account on [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/). Set up\na project and create an API key with `write` access to your index, and with the ACL permissions\n`addObject`, `editSettings` and `deleteIndex`. Now, create a secret on the Modal [Secrets](/secrets)\npage with the `API_KEY` and `APPLICATION_ID` you just created. You can name this anything you want,\nwe named it `algolia-secret`.\n## The actual function\nWe want to trigger our crawler from our CI/CD pipeline, so we're serving it as a\n[web endpoint](/docs/guide/webhooks#web_endpoint) that can be triggered by a `GET` request during deploy.\nYou could also consider running the crawler on a [schedule](/docs/guide/cron).\nThe Algolia crawler is written for Python 3.6 and needs to run in the `pipenv` created for it,\nso we're invoking it using a subprocess.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    image=algolia_image, secrets=[Secret.from_name(\"algolia-secret\")]\n)\ndef crawl():\n    # Installed with a 3.6 venv; Python 3.6 is unsupported by Modal, so use a subprocess instead.\n    subprocess.run(\n        [\"pipenv\", \"run\", \"python\", \"-m\", \"src.index\"],\n        env={**os.environ, \"CONFIG\": json.dumps(CONFIG)},\n    )\n```\nWe want to be able to trigger this function through a webhook.\n```python\n@stub.function()\n@web_endpoint()\ndef crawl_webhook():\n    crawl.remote()\n    return \"Finished indexing docs\"\n```\n## Deploy the indexer\nThat's all the code we need! To deploy your application, run\n```shell\nmodal deploy algolia_indexer.py\n```\nIf successful, this will print a URL for your new webhook, that you can hit using\n`curl` or a browser. Logs from webhook invocations can be found from the [apps](/apps)\npage.\nThe indexed contents can be found at https://www.algolia.com/apps/APP_ID/explorer/browse/, for your\nAPP_ID. Once you're happy with the results, you can [set up the `docsearch` package with your\nwebsite](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/docsearch-v3/), and create a search component that uses this index.\n## Entrypoint for development\nTo make it easier to test this, we also have an entrypoint for when you run\n`modal run algolia_indexer.py`\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef run():\n    crawl.remote()\n```\n"}

See https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/seeds for more info.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    mounts=[dbt_project],\n    secrets=[s3_secret],\n)\ndef create_source_data():\n    import boto3\n    import pandas as pd\n    s3_client = boto3.client(\"s3\")\n    s3_client.create_bucket(Bucket=BUCKET_NAME)\n    for seed_csv_path in Path(PROJ_PATH, \"seeds\").glob(\"*.csv\"):\n        print(f\"found seed file {seed_csv_path}\")\n        name = seed_csv_path.stem\n        df = pd.read_csv(seed_csv_path)\n        parquet_filename = f\"{name}.parquet\"\n        df.to_parquet(parquet_filename)\n        object_key = f\"sources/{parquet_filename}\"\n        print(f\"uploading {object_key=} to S3 bucket '{BUCKET_NAME}'\")\n        s3_client.upload_file(parquet_filename, BUCKET_NAME, object_key)\n```\nThis `daily_build` function runs on a schedule to keep the DuckDB data warehouse\nup-to-date. Currently, the source data for this warehouse is static, so the updates\ndon't really update anything, just re-build. But this example could be extended\nto have sources which continually provide new data across time.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    schedule=modal.Period(days=1),\n    secrets=[s3_secret],\n    mounts=[dbt_project, dbt_profiles],\n    network_file_systems={TARGET_PATH: dbt_target},\n)\ndef daily_build() -> None:\n    run(\"build\")\n```\n`modal run dbt_duckdb.py::run --command run`\nA successful run will log something a lot like the following:\n```\n03:41:04  Running with dbt=1.5.0\n03:41:05  Found 5 models, 8 tests, 0 snapshots, 0 analyses, 313 macros, 0 operations, 3 seed files, 3 sources, 0 exposures, 0 metrics, 0 groups\n03:41:05\n03:41:06  Concurrency: 1 threads (target='modal')\n03:41:06\n03:41:06  1 of 5 START sql table model main.stg_customers ................................

{"text": "\n# Machine learning model inference endpoint that uses the webcam\nThis example creates a web endpoint that uses a Huggingface model for object detection.\nThe web endpoint takes an image from their webcam, and sends it to a Modal web endpoint.\nThe Modal web endpoint in turn calls a Modal function that runs the actual model.\nIf you run this, it will look something like this:\n![webcam](./webcam.png)\n## Live demo\n[Take a look at the deployed app](https://modal-labs-example-webcam-object-detection-fastapi-app.modal.run/).\nA couple of caveats:\n* This is not optimized for latency: every prediction takes about 1s, and\n  there's an additional overhead on the first prediction since the containers\n  have to be started and the model initialized.\n* This doesn't work on iPhone unfortunately due to some issues with HTML5\n  webcam components\n## Code\nStarting with imports:\n```python\nimport base64\nimport io\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Response\nfrom fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles\nfrom modal import (\n    Image,\n    Mount,\n    Stub,\n    asgi_app,\n    method,\n)\n```\nWe need to install [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)\nwhich is a package Huggingface uses for all their models, but also\n[Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) which lets us work with images from Python,\nand a system font for drawing.\nThis example uses the `facebook/detr-resnet-50` pre-trained model, which is downloaded\nonce at image build time using the `download_model` function and saved into the image.\n'Baking' models into the `modal.Image` at build time provided the fastest cold start.\n```python\nmodel_repo_id = \"facebook/detr-resnet-50\"\ndef download_model():\n    from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\n    snapshot_download(repo_id=model_repo_id, cache_dir=\"/cache\")\nstub = Stub(\"example-webcam-object-detection\")\nimage = (\n    Image.debian_slim()\n    .pip_install(\n        \"huggingface-hub==0.16.4\",\n        \"Pillow\",\n        \"timm\",\n        \"transformers\",\n    )\n    .apt_install(\"fonts-freefont-ttf\")\n    .run_function(download_model)\n)\n```\n## Prediction function\nThe object detection function has a few different features worth mentioning:\n* There's a container initialization step in the `__enter__` method, which\n  runs on every container start. This lets us load the model only once per\n  container, so that it's reused for subsequent function calls.\n* Above we stored the model in the container image. This lets us download the model only\n  when the image is (re)built, and not everytime the function is called.\n* We're running it on multiple CPUs for extra performance\nNote that the function takes an image and returns a new image.\nThe input image is from the webcam\nThe output image is an image with all the bounding boxes and labels on them,\nwith an alpha channel so that most of the image is transparent so that the\nweb interface can render it on top of the webcam view.\n```python\n@stub.cls(\n    cpu=4,\n    image=image,\n)\nclass ObjectDetection:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        from transformers import DetrForObjectDetection, DetrImageProcessor\n        self.feature_extractor = DetrImageProcessor.from_pretrained(\n            model_repo_id,\n            cache_dir=\"/cache\",\n        )\n        self.model = DetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained(\n            model_repo_id,\n            cache_dir=\"/cache\",\n        )\n    @method()\n    def detect(self, img_data_in):\n        # Based on https://huggingface.co/spaces/nateraw/detr-object-detection/blob/main/app.py\n        from PIL import Image, ImageColor, ImageDraw, ImageFont\n        # Read png from input\n        image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(img_data_in)).convert(\"RGB\")\n        # Make prediction\n        import torch\n        inputs = self.feature_extractor(image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n        outputs = self.model(**inputs)\n        img_size = torch.tensor([tuple(reversed(image.size))])\n        processed_outputs = (\n            self.feature_extractor.post_process_object_detection(\n                outputs=outputs,\n                target_sizes=img_size,\n                threshold=0,\n            )\n        )\n        output_dict = processed_outputs[0]\n        # Grab boxes\n        keep = output_dict[\"scores\"] > 0.7\n        boxes = output_dict[\"boxes\"][keep].tolist()\n        scores = output_dict[\"scores\"][keep].tolist()\n        labels = output_dict[\"labels\"][keep].tolist()\n        # Plot bounding boxes\n        colors = list(ImageColor.colormap.values())\n        font = ImageFont.truetype(\n            \"/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeMono.ttf\", 18\n        )\n        output_image = Image.new(\"RGBA\", (image.width, image.height))\n        output_image_draw = ImageDraw.Draw(output_image)\n        for _score, box, label in zip(scores, boxes, labels):\n            color = colors[label % len(colors)]\n            text = self.model.config.id2label[label]\n            box = tuple(map(int, box))\n            output_image_draw.rectangle(box, outline=color)\n            output_image_draw.text(\n                box[:2], text, font=font, fill=color, width=3\n            )\n        # Return PNG as bytes\n        with io.BytesIO() as output_buf:\n            output_image.save(output_buf, format=\"PNG\")\n            return output_buf.getvalue()\n```\n## Defining the web interface\nTo keep things clean, we define the web endpoints separate from the prediction\nfunction. This will introduce a tiny bit of extra latency (every web request\ntriggers a Modal function call which will call another Modal function) but in\npractice the overhead is much smaller than the overhead of running the prediction\nfunction etc.\nWe also serve a static html page which contains some tiny bit of Javascript to\ncapture the webcam feed and send it to Modal.\n```python\nweb_app = FastAPI()\nstatic_path = Path(__file__).with_name(\"webcam\").resolve()\n```\nThe endpoint for the prediction function takes an image as a\n[data URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme)\nand returns another image, also as a data URI:\n```python\n@web_app.post(\"/predict\")\nasync def predict(request: Request):\n    # Takes a webcam image as a datauri, returns a bounding box image as a datauri\n    body = await request.body()\n    img_data_in = base64.b64decode(body.split(b\",\")[1])  # read data-uri\n    img_data_out = ObjectDetection().detect.remote(img_data_in)\n    output_data = b\"data:image/png;base64,\" + base64.b64encode(img_data_out)\n    return Response(content=output_data)\n```\n## Exposing the web server\nLet's take the Fast API app and expose it to Modal.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    mounts=[Mount.from_local_dir(static_path, remote_path=\"/assets\")],\n)\n@asgi_app()\ndef fastapi_app():\n    web_app.mount(\"/\", StaticFiles(directory=\"/assets\", html=True))\n    return web_app\n```\n## Running this locally\nYou can run this as an ephemeral app, by running\n```shell\nmodal serve webcam.py\n```\n"}

The CIFAR-10 dataset is\nalso not large, about 150MB, so we don't bother persisting it in a network file system\nand just download and unpack it to ephemeral disk.\n```python\ndef download_dataset():\n    from fastai.data.external import URLs, untar_data\n    path = untar_data(URLs.CIFAR)\n    print(f\"Finished downloading and unpacking CIFAR-10 dataset to {path}.\")\n    return path\n```\n## Training a vision model with FastAI\nTo address the CIFAR-10 image classification problem, we use the high-level fastAI framework\nto train a Deep Residual Network (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) with 18-layers, called `resnet18`.\nWe don't train the model from scratch. A transfer learning approach is sufficient to reach 98-99%\naccuracy on the classification task. The main tweak we make is to adjust the image size of the CIFAR-10\nexamples to be 224x224, which was the image size the `resnet18` model was originally trained on.\nJust to demonstrate the affect of the image upscaling on classification performance, we still train on\nthe original size 32x32 images.\n### Tracking with Weights & Biases\n![weights & biases UI](./wandb-ui.png)\nWeights & Biases (W&B) is a product that provides out-of-the-box model training observability. With a few\nlines of code and an account, we gain a dashboard will key metrics such as training loss, accuracy, and GPU\nutilization.\nIf you want to run this example without setting up Weights & Biases, just remove the\n`secret=Secret.from_name(\"wandb\")` line from the Function decorator below; this will disable Weights & Biases\nfunctionality.\n### Detaching our training run\nFine-tuning the base ResNet model takes about 30-40 minutes on a GPU.

{"text": "# Write to Google Sheets\nIn this tutorial, we'll show how to use Modal to schedule a daily update of a dataset\nfrom an analytics database to Google Sheets.\n## Entering credentials\nWe begin by setting up some credentials that we'll need in order to access our database and output\nspreadsheet. To do that in a secure manner, we log in to our Modal account on the web and go to\nthe [Secrets](/secrets) section.\n### Database\nFirst we will enter our database credentials. The easiest way to do this is to click **New\nsecret** and select the **Postgres compatible** secret preset and fill in the requested\ninformation. Then we press **Next** and name our secret \"analytics-database\" and click **Create**.\n### Google Sheets/GCP\nWe'll now add another Secret for Google Sheets access through Google Cloud Platform. Click **New\nsecret** and select the Google Sheets preset.\nIn order to access the Google Sheets API, we'll need to create a *Service Account* in Google Cloud\nPlatform. You can skip this step if you already have a Service Account json file.\n1. Sign up to Google Cloud Platform or log in if you haven't\n   ([https://cloud.google.com/](https://cloud.google.com/)).\n2. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n3. In the navigation pane on the left, go to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**.\n4. Click the **+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT** button.\n5. Give the service account a suitable name, like \"sheet-access-bot\". Click **Done**. You don't\n   have to grant it any specific access privileges at this time.\n6. Click your new service account in the list view that appears and navigate to the **Keys**\n   section.\n7. Click **Add key** and choose **Create new key**. Use the **JSON** key type and confirm by\n   clicking **Create**.\n8. A json key file should be downloaded to your computer at this point. Copy the contents of that\n   file and use it as the value for the **SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON** field in your new secret.\nWe'll name this other secret \"gsheets\".\nNow you can access the values of your secrets from modal functions that you annotate with the\ncorresponding EnvDict includes, e.g.:\n```python\nimport os\nimport modal\nstub = modal.Stub(\"example-db-to-sheet\")\n@stub.function(secret=modal.Secret.from_name(\"postgres-secret\"))\ndef my_func():\n    # automatically filled from the specified secret\n    print(\"Host is \" + os.environ[\"PGHOST\"])\n```\nIn order to connect to the database, we'll use the `psycopg2` Python package. To make it available\nto your Modal function you need to supply it with an `image` argument that tells Modal how to\nbuild the container image that contains that package. We'll base it off of the `Image.debian_slim` base\nimage that's built into modal, and make sure to install the required binary packages as well as\nthe psycopg2 package itself:\n```python\npg_image = (\n    modal.Image.debian_slim().apt_install(\"libpq-dev\").pip_install(\"psycopg2\")\n)\n```\nSince the default keynames for a **Postgres compatible** secret correspond to the environment\nvariables that `psycopg2` looks for, you can now easily connect to the database even without\nexplicit credentials in your code. We'll create a simple function that queries the city for each\nuser in our dummy `users` table:\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    image=pg_image,\n    secret=modal.Secret.from_name(\"postgres-secret\"),\n)\ndef get_db_rows():\n    import psycopg2\n    conn = psycopg2.connect()  # no explicit credentials needed\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n    cur.execute(\"SELECT city FROM users\")\n    return [row[0] for row in cur.fetchall()]\n```\nNote that we import psycopg2 inside our function instead of the global scope. This allows us to\nrun this Modal function even from an environment where psycopg2 is not installed. We can test run\nthis function using the `modal run` shell command: `modal run db_to_sheet.py::stub.get_db_rows`.\n## Applying Python logic\nFor each city in our source data we'll make an online lookup of the current weather using the\n[http://openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org) API. To do this, we'll add the API key to\nanother modal secret. We'll use a custom secret called \"weather\" with the key\n`OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` containing our API key for OpenWeatherMap.\n```python\nrequests_image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\"requests\")\n@stub.function(\n    image=requests_image,\n    secret=modal.Secret.from_name(\"weather-secret\"),\n)\ndef city_weather(city):\n    import requests\n    url = \"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n    params = {\"q\": city, \"appid\": os.environ[\"OPENWEATHER_API_KEY\"]}\n    response = requests.get(url, params=params)\n    weather_label = response.json()[\"weather\"][0][\"main\"]\n    return weather_label\n```\nWe'll make use of Modal's built-in `function.map` method to create our report. `function.map`\nmakes it really easy to parallelise work by executing a function for a larger sequence of input\ndata. For this example we'll make a simple count of rows per weather type, using Python's\nstandard library `collections.Counter`.\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n@stub.function()\ndef create_report(cities):\n    # run city_weather for each city in parallel\n    user_weather = city_weather.map(cities)\n    users_by_weather = Counter(user_weather).items()\n    return users_by_weather\n```\nLet's try to run this! To make it simple to trigger the function with some\npredefined input data, we create a \"local entrypoint\" `main` that can be\neasily triggered from the command line:\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef main():\n    cities = [\n        \"Stockholm,,Sweden\",\n        \"New York,NY,USA\",\n        \"Tokyo,,Japan\",\n    ]\n    print(create_report.remote(cities))\n```\nRunning the local entrypoint using `modal run db_to_sheet.py` should print something like:\n`dict_items([('Clouds', 3)])`.\nNote that since this file only has a single stub, and the stub has only one local entrypoint\nwe only have to specify the file to run - the function/entrypoint is inferred.\nIn this case the logic is quite simple, but in a real world context you could have applied a\nmachine learning model or any other tool you could build into a container to transform the data.\n## Sending output to a Google Sheet\nWe'll set up a new Google Sheet to send our report to. Using the \"Sharing\" dialog in Google\nSheets, we make sure to share the document to the service account's email address (the value of\nthe `client_email` field in the json file) and make the service account an editor of the document.\nThe URL of a Google Sheet is something like:\n`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wOktal......IJR77jD8Do`.\nWe copy the part of the URL that comes after `/d/` - that is the *key* of the document which\nwe'll refer to in our code. We'll make use of the `pygsheets` python package to authenticate with\nGoogle Sheets and then update the spreadsheet with information from the report we just created:\n```python\npygsheets_image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\"pygsheets\")\n@stub.function(\n    image=pygsheets_image,\n    secret=modal.Secret.from_name(\"gsheets-secret\"),\n)\ndef update_sheet_report(rows):\n    import pygsheets\n    gc = pygsheets.authorize(service_account_env_var=\"SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON\")\n    document_key = \"1RqQrJ6Ikf611adKunm8tmL1mKzHLjNwLWm_T7mfXSYA\"\n    sh = gc.open_by_key(document_key)\n    worksheet = sh.sheet1\n    worksheet.clear(\"A2\")\n    worksheet.update_values(\"A2\", [list(row) for row in rows])\n```\nAt this point, we have everything we need in order to run the full program. We can put it all together in\nanother Modal function, and add a [schedule](/docs/guide/cron) argument so it runs every day automatically:\n```python\n@stub.function(schedule=modal.Cron(\"0 0 * * *\"))\ndef db_to_sheet():\n    rows = get_db_rows.remote()\n    report = create_report.remote(rows)\n    update_sheet_report.remote(report)\n    print(\"Updated sheet with new weather distribution\")\n    for weather, count in report:\n        print(f\"{weather}: {count}\")\n```\nThis entire stub can now be deployed using `modal deploy db_to_sheet.py`.

{"text": "\n# Stable diffusion slackbot\nThis tutorial shows you how to build a Slackbot that uses\n[stable diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release)\nto produce realistic images from text prompts on demand.\n![stable diffusion slackbot](./stable_diff_screenshot.jpg)\n## Basic setup\n```python\nimport io\nimport os\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom modal import Image, Secret, Stub, web_endpoint\n```\nAll Modal programs need a [`Stub`](/docs/reference/modal.Stub) \u2014 an object that acts as a recipe for\nthe application. Let's give it a friendly name.\n```python\nstub = Stub(\"example-stable-diff-bot\")\n```\n## Inference Function\n### HuggingFace token\nWe're going to use the pre-trained stable diffusion model in\nHuggingFace's `diffusers` library. To gain access, you need to sign in to your\nHuggingFace account ([sign up here](https://huggingface.co/join)) and request\naccess on the [model card page](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5).\nNext, [create a HuggingFace access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).\nTo access the token in a Modal function, we can create a secret on the\n[secrets page](https://modal.com/secrets). Let's use the environment variable\nnamed `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`. Functions that inject this secret will have access\nto the environment variable.\n![create a huggingface token](./huggingface_token.png)\n### Model caching\nThe `diffusers` library downloads the weights for a pre-trained model to a local\ndirectory, if those weights don't already exist. To decrease start-up time, we want\nthis download to happen just once, even across separate function invocations.\nTo accomplish this, we use simple function that will run at image build time and save the model into\nthe image's filesystem.\n```python\nCACHE_PATH = \"/root/model_cache\"\ndef fetch_model(local_files_only: bool = False):\n    from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline\n    from torch import float16\n    return StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n        \"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\",\n        use_auth_token=os.environ[\"HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN\"],\n        variant=\"fp16\",\n        torch_dtype=float16,\n        device_map=\"auto\",\n        cache_dir=CACHE_PATH,  # reads model saved in the modal.Image's filesystem.\n        local_files_only=local_files_only,\n    )\nimage = (\n    Image.debian_slim()\n    .run_commands(\n        \"pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117\"\n    )\n    .pip_install(\n        \"diffusers\",\n        \"huggingface-hub\",\n        \"safetensors\",\n        \"transformers\",\n        \"scipy\",\n        \"ftfy\",\n        \"accelerate\",\n    )\n    .run_function(fetch_model, secret=Secret.from_name(\"huggingface-secret\"))\n)\n```\n### The actual function\nNow that we have our token and `modal.Image` set up, we can put everything together.\nLet's define a function that takes a text prompt and an optional channel name\n(so we can post results to Slack if the value is set) and runs stable diffusion.\nThe `@stub.function()` decorator declares all the resources this function will\nuse: we configure it to use a GPU, run on an image that has all the packages and files we\nneed to run the model, and\nalso provide it the secret that contains the token we created above.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    gpu=\"A10G\",\n    image=image,\n    secret=Secret.from_name(\"huggingface-secret\"),\n)\nasync def run_stable_diffusion(prompt: str, channel_name: Optional[str] = None):\n    pipe = fetch_model(local_files_only=True)\n    image = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=100).images[0]\n    # Convert PIL Image to PNG byte array.\n    with io.BytesIO() as buf:\n        image.save(buf, format=\"PNG\")\n        img_bytes = buf.getvalue()\n    if channel_name:\n        # `post_image_to_slack` is implemented further below.\n        post_image_to_slack.remote(prompt, channel_name, img_bytes)\n    return img_bytes\n```\n## Slack webhook\nNow that we wrote our function, we'd like to trigger it from Slack. We can do\nthis with [slash commands](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands)\n\u2014 a feature that lets you register prefixes (such as `/run-my-bot`) to\ntrigger webhooks of your choice.\nTo serve our model as a web endpoint, we apply the\n[`@stub.web_endpoint`](/docs/guide/webhooks#web_endpoint) decorator in addition to\n`@stub.function()`. Modal webhooks are [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)\nendpoints by default (though we accept any ASGI web framework). This webhook\nretrieves the form body passed from Slack.\nInstead of blocking on the result of the stable diffusion model (which could\ntake some time), we want to notify the user immediately that their request\nis being processed. Modal Functions let you\n[`spawn`](/docs/reference/modal.Function#spawn) an input without waiting for\nthe results, which we use here to kick off model inference as a background task.\n```python\nfrom fastapi import Request\n@stub.function()\n@web_endpoint(method=\"POST\")\nasync def entrypoint(request: Request):\n    body = await request.form()\n    prompt = body[\"text\"]\n    run_stable_diffusion.spawn(prompt, body[\"channel_name\"])\n    return f\"Running stable diffusion for {prompt}.\"\n```\n## Post to Slack\nFinally, let's define a function to post images to a Slack channel.\nFirst, we need to create a Slack app and store the token for our app as a\nModal secret. To do so, visit the the Modal [Secrets](/secrets) page and click\n\"create a Slack secret\". Then, you will find instructions on how to create a\nSlack app, give it OAuth permissions, and get a token. Note that you need to\nadd the `file:write` OAuth scope to the created app.\n![create a slack secret](./slack_secret.png)\nBelow, we use the secret and `slack-sdk` to post to a Slack channel.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    image=Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\"slack-sdk\"),\n    secret=Secret.from_name(\"stable-diff-slackbot-secret\"),\n)\ndef post_image_to_slack(title: str, channel_name: str, image_bytes: bytes):\n    import slack_sdk\n    client = slack_sdk.WebClient(token=os.environ[\"SLACK_BOT_TOKEN\"])\n    client.files_upload(channels=channel_name, title=title, content=image_bytes)\n```\n## Deploy the Slackbot\nThat's all the code we need! To deploy your application, run\n```shell\nmodal deploy stable_diffusion_slackbot.py\n```\nIf successful, this will print a URL for your new webhook. To point your Slack\napp at it:\n- Go back to the [Slack apps page](https://api.slack.com/apps/).\n- Find your app and navigate to \"Slash Commands\" under \"Features\" in the left\n  sidebar.\n- Click on \"Create New Command\" and paste the webhook URL from Modal into the\n  \"Request URL\" field.\n- Name the command whatever you like, and hit \"Save\".\n- Reinstall the app to your workspace.\nWe're done! \ud83c\udf89 Install the app to any channel you're in, and you can trigger it\nwith the command you chose above.\n## Run Manually\nWe can also trigger `run_stable_diffusion` manually for easier debugging.\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef run(\n    prompt: str = \"oil painting of a shiba\",\n    output_dir: str = \"/tmp/stable-diffusion\",\n):\n    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    img_bytes = run_stable_diffusion.remote(prompt)\n    output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, \"output.png\")\n    with open(output_path, \"wb\") as f:\n        f.write(img_bytes)\n    print(f\"Wrote data to {output_path}\")\n```\nThis code lets us call our script as follows:\n```shell\nmodal run stable_diffusion_slackbot.py --prompt \"a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars\"\n```\nThe resulting image can be found in `/tmp/stable-diffusion/output.png`.\n"}

a demo, any demo\nSimply by changing the `DEMO_NAME` below, you can change which ControlNet demo app is setup\nand run by this Modal script.\n```python\nDEMO_NAME = \"scribble2image\"  # Change this value to change the active demo app.\nselected_demo = demos_map[DEMO_NAME]\n```\n## Setting up the dependencies\nControlNet requires *a lot* of dependencies which could be fiddly to setup manually, but Modal's programmatic\ncontainer image building Python APIs handle this complexity straightforwardly and automatically.\nTo run any of the 10 demo apps, we need the following:\n1. a base Python 3 Linux image (we use Debian Slim)\n2. a bunch of third party PyPi packages\n3. `git`, so that we can download the ControlNet source code (there's no `controlnet` PyPi package)\n4. some image process Linux system packages, including `ffmpeg`\n5. and demo specific pre-trained model and detector `.pth` files\nThat's a lot! Fortunately, the code below is already written for you that stitches together a working container image\nready to produce remarkable ControlNet images.\n**Note:** a ControlNet model pipeline is [now available in Huggingface's `diffusers` package](https://huggingface.co/blog/controlnet).

We want the block interface object,\nbut the queueing and launched webserver aren't compatible with Modal's serverless web endpoint interface,\nso in the `import_gradio_app_blocks` function we patch out these behaviors.\n```python\ndef import_gradio_app_blocks(demo: DemoApp):\n    from gradio import blocks\n    # The ControlNet repo demo scripts are written to be run as\n    # standalone scripts, and have a lot of code that executes\n    # in global scope on import, including the launch of a Gradio web server.\n    # We want Modal to control the Gradio web app serving, so we\n    # monkeypatch the .launch() function to be a no-op.\n    blocks.Blocks.launch = lambda self, server_name: print(\n        \"launch() has been monkeypatched to do nothing.\"\n    )\n    # each demo app module is a file like gradio_{name}.py\n    module_name = f\"gradio_{demo.name}\"\n    mod = importlib.import_module(module_name)\n    blocks = mod.block\n    # disable queueing mode, which is incompatible with our Modal web app setup.\n    blocks.enable_queue = False\n    return blocks\n```\nBecause the ControlNet gradio app's are so time and compute intensive to cold-start\nthe web app function is limited to running just 1 warm container. This way, while playing\nwith the demos we can pay the cold-start cost once and have all web requests hit the warm\ncontainer. Spinning up extra containers to handle additional requests would not be efficient\ngiven the cold-start time.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    gpu=\"A10G\",\n    concurrency_limit=1,\n    keep_warm=1,\n)\n@asgi_app()\ndef run():\n    from gradio.routes import mount_gradio_app\n    # mount for execution on Modal\n    return mount_gradio_app(\n        app=web_app,\n        blocks=import_gradio_app_blocks(demo=selected_demo),\n        path=\"/\",\n    )\n```\n## Have fun!\nServe your chosen demo app with `modal serve controlnet_gradio_demos.py`. If you don't have any images ready at hand,\ntry one that's in the `06_gpu_and_ml/controlnet/demo_images/` folder.\nStableDiffusion was already impressive enough, but ControlNet's ability to so accurately and intuitively constrain\nthe image generation process is sure to put a big, dumb grin on your face.\n"}
{"text": "\n# Serve a dynamic SVG badge\nIn this example, we use Modal's [webhook](/docs/guide/webhooks) capability to host a dynamic SVG badge that shows\nyou the current # of downloads for a Python package.\nFirst let's start off by creating a Modal stub, and defining an image with the Python packages we're going to be using:\n```python\nfrom modal import Image, Stub, web_endpoint\nstub = Stub(\n    \"example-web-badges\",\n    image=Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\"pybadges\", \"pypistats\"),\n)\n```\n## Defining the web endpoint\nIn addition to using `@stub.function()` to decorate our function, we use the\n`@modal.web_endpoint` decorator ([learn more](/docs/guide/webhooks#web_endpoint)), which instructs Modal\nto create a REST endpoint that serves this function. Note that the default method is `GET`, but this\ncan be overridden using the `method` argument.\n```python\n@stub.function()\n@web_endpoint()\nasync def package_downloads(package_name: str):\n    import json\n    import pypistats\n    from fastapi import Response\n    from pybadges import badge\n    stats = json.loads(pypistats.recent(package_name, format=\"json\"))\n    svg = badge(\n        left_text=f\"{package_name} downloads\",\n        right_text=str(stats[\"data\"][\"last_month\"]),\n        right_color=\"blue\",\n    )\n    return Response(content=svg, media_type=\"image/svg+xml\")\n```\nIn this function, we use `pypistats` to query the most recent stats for our package, and then\nuse that as the text for a SVG badge, rendered using `pybadges`.\nSince Modal web endpoints are FastAPI functions under the hood, we return this SVG wrapped in a FastAPI response with the correct media type.\nAlso note that FastAPI automatically interprets `package_name` as a [query param](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params/).\n## Running and deploying\nWe can now run an ephemeral app on the command line using:\n```shell\nmodal serve badges.py\n```\nThis will create a short-lived web url that exists until you terminate the script.\nIt will also hot-reload the code if you make changes to it.\nIf you want to create a persistent URL, you have to deploy the script.\nTo deploy using the Modal CLI by running `modal deploy badges.py`,\nEither way, as soon as we run this command, Modal gives us the link to our brand new\nweb endpoint in the output:\n![web badge deployment](./badges_deploy.png)\nWe can now visit the link using a web browser, using a `package_name` of our choice in the URL query params.\nFor example:\n- `https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.modal.run/?package_name=synchronicity`\n- `https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.modal.run/?package_name=torch`\n"}

As a simple *remote* call `f.remote(1000)`\n3.

It will take the code, put it inside a\ncontainer, run it, and stream all the output back to your local\ncomputer.\nTry doing one of these things next.\n### Change the code and run again\nFor instance, change the `print` statement in the function `f`.\nYou can see that the latest code is always run.\nModal's goal is to make running code in the cloud feel like you're\nrunning code locally. You don't need to run any commands to rebuild,\npush containers, or go to a web UI to download logs.\n### Map over a larger dataset\nChange the map range from 20 to some large number. You can see that\nModal will create and run more containers in parallel.\nThe function `f` is obviously silly and doesn't do much, but you could\nimagine something more significant, like:\n* Training a machine learning model\n* Transcoding media\n* Backtesting a trading algorithm.\nModal lets you parallelize that operation trivially by running hundreds or\nthousands of containers in the cloud.\n"}

{"text": "\n# Using the ChatGPT streaming API\nThis example shows how to stream from the ChatGPT API as the model is generating a completion, instead of\nwaiting for the entire completion to finish. This provides a much better user experience, and is what you\nget when playing with ChatGPT on [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/).\nYou can try this out from the command line using the `modal` CLI, or serve the application and use the\nincluded web endpoint.\n## Imports and Modal application configuration\nOpenAI's Python client library is the only package dependency we need. We also need an API key.\nThe former is specified in the Modal application's `image` definition, and the latter is attached to the app's\nstub as a [`modal.Secret`](/docs/guide/secrets).\n```python\nfrom modal import Image, Secret, Stub, web_endpoint\nimage = Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\"openai\")\nstub = Stub(\n    name=\"example-chatgpt-stream\",\n    image=image,\n    secrets=[Secret.from_name(\"openai-secret\")],\n)\n```\nThis is all the code needed to stream answers back from ChatGPT.\nNot much code to worry about!\nBecause this Python function is decorated with `@stub.function`, it becomes\ncallable as a Modal remote function. But `stream_chat` can still be used as a\nregular Python function, which becomes important below.\n```python\n@stub.function()\ndef stream_chat(prompt: str):\n    import openai\n    for chunk in openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n        stream=True,\n    ):\n        content = chunk[\"choices\"][0].get(\"delta\", {}).get(\"content\")\n        if content is not None:\n            yield content\n```\n## Streaming web endpoint\nThese four lines are all you need to take that function above and serve it\nover HTTP. It is a single function definition, annotated with decorators to make\nit a Modal function [with a web serving capability](/docs/guide/webhooks).\nNotice that the `stream_chat` function is passed into the retuned streaming response.\nThis works because the function is a generator and is thus compatible with streaming.\nWe use the standard Python calling convention `stream_chat(...)` and not the\nModal-specific calling convention `stream_chat.remote(...)`.

{"text": "\n# Batch inference using a model from Huggingface\n<center>\n  <img src=\"./batch_inference_huggingface.png\" alt=\"Huggingface company logo\" />\n</center>\nThis example shows how to use a sentiment analysis model from Huggingface to classify\n25,000 movie reviews in a couple of minutes.\nSome Modal features it uses:\n* Container lifecycle hook: this lets us load the model only once in each container\n* CPU requests: the prediction function is very CPU-hungry, so we reserve 8 cores\n* Mapping: we map over 25,000 sentences and Modal manages the pool of containers for us\n## Basic setup\nLet's get started writing code.\nFor the Modal container image, we need a few Python packages,\nincluding `transformers`, which is the main Huggingface package.\n```python\nimport io\nimport modal\nstub = modal.Stub(\n    \"example-batch-inference-using-huggingface\",\n    image=modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\n        \"datasets\",\n        \"matplotlib\",\n        \"scikit-learn\",\n        \"torch\",\n        \"transformers\",\n    ),\n)\n```\n## Defining the prediction function\nInstead of a using `@stub.function()` in the global scope,\nwe put the method on a class, and define an `__enter__` method on that class.\nModal reuses containers for successive calls to the same function, so\nwe want to take advantage of this and avoid setting up the same model\nfor every function call.\nSince the transformer model is very CPU-hungry, we allocate 8 CPUs\nto the model.\nEvery container that runs will have 8 CPUs set aside for it.\n```python\n@stub.cls(cpu=8, retries=3)\nclass SentimentAnalysis:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        from transformers import pipeline\n        self.sentiment_pipeline = pipeline(\n            model=\"distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english\"\n        )\n    @modal.method()\n    def predict(self, phrase: str):\n        pred = self.sentiment_pipeline(\n            phrase, truncation=True, max_length=512, top_k=2\n        )\n        # pred will look like: [{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.99}, {'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.01}]\n        probs = {p[\"label\"]: p[\"score\"] for p in pred}\n        return probs[\"POSITIVE\"]\n```\n## Getting data\nWe need some data to run the batch inference on.\nWe use this [dataset of IMDB reviews](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) for this purpose.\nHuggingface actually offers this data [as a preprocessed dataaset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb),\nwhich we can download using the `datasets` package:\n```python\n@stub.function()\ndef get_data():\n    from datasets import load_dataset\n    imdb = load_dataset(\"imdb\")\n    data = [(row[\"text\"], row[\"label\"]) for row in imdb[\"test\"]]\n    return data\n```\n## Plotting the ROC curve\nIn order to evaluate the classifier, let's plot an\n[ROC curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic).\nThis is a common way to evaluate classifiers on binary data.\n```python\n@stub.function()\ndef roc_plot(labels, predictions):\n    from matplotlib import pyplot\n    from sklearn.metrics import RocCurveDisplay\n    pyplot.style.use(\"ggplot\")\n    RocCurveDisplay.from_predictions(labels, predictions)\n    with io.BytesIO() as buf:\n        pyplot.savefig(buf, format=\"png\")\n        return buf.getvalue()\n```\nA bit of a spoiler warning, but if you run this script, the ROC curve will look like this:\n![roc](./batch_inference_roc.png)\nThe AUC of this classifier is 0.96, which means it's very good!\n## Putting it together\nThe main flow of the code downloads the data, then runs the batch inference,\nthen plots the results.\nEach prediction takes roughly 0.1-1s, so if we ran everything sequentially it would take 2,500-25,000 seconds.\nThat's a lot! Luckily because of Modal's `.map` method, we can process everything in a couple of minutes at most.\nModal will automatically spin up more and more workers until all inputs are processed.\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef main():\n    print(\"Downloading data...\")\n    data = get_data.remote()\n    print(\"Got\", len(data), \"reviews\")\n    reviews = [review for review, label in data]\n    labels = [label for review, label in data]\n    # Let's check that the model works by classifying the first 5 entries\n    predictor = SentimentAnalysis()\n    for review, label in data[:5]:\n        prediction = predictor.predict.remote(review)\n        print(\n            f\"Sample prediction with positivity score {prediction}:\\n{review}\\n\\n\"\n        )\n    # Now, let's run batch inference over it\n    print(\"Running batch prediction...\")\n    predictions = list(predictor.predict.map(reviews))\n    # Generate a ROC plot\n    print(\"Creating ROC plot...\")\n    png_data = roc_plot.remote(labels, predictions)\n    fn = \"/tmp/roc.png\"\n    with open(fn, \"wb\") as f:\n        f.write(png_data)\n    print(f\"Wrote ROC curve to {fn}\")\n```\n## Running this\nWhen you run this, it will download the dataset and load the model, then output some\nsample predictions:\n```\nSample prediction with positivity score 0.0003837468393612653:\nI love sci-fi and am willing to put up with a lot. Sci-fi movies/TV are usually underfunded, under-appreciated and misunderstood. I tried to like this, I really did, but it is to good TV sci-fi as Babylon 5 is to Star Trek (the original). Silly prosthetics, cheap cardboard sets, stilted dialogues, CG that doesn't match the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a 'sci-fi' setting. (I'm sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV. It's not. It's clich\u00e9d and uninspiring.) While US viewers might like emotion and character development, sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf. Star Trek). It may treat important issues, yet not as a serious philosophy. It's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish, just missing a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to watch. The makers of Earth KNOW it's rubbish as they have to always say \"Gene Roddenberry's Earth...\" otherwise people would not continue watching. Roddenberry's ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull, cheap, poorly edited (watching it without advert breaks really brings this home) trudging Trabant of a show lumbers into space. Spoiler. So, kill off a main character. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas all over again.\nSample prediction with positivity score 0.38294079899787903:\nWorth the entertainment value of a rental, especially if you like action movies. This one features the usual car chases, fights with the great Van Damme kick style, shooting battles with the 40 shell load shotgun, and even terrorist style bombs. All of this is entertaining and competently handled but there is nothing that really blows you away if you've seen your share before.<br /><br />The plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit, which is clever but hardly profound. Many of the characters are heavily stereotyped -- the angry veterans, the terrified illegal aliens, the crooked cops, the indifferent feds, the bitchy tough lady station head, the crooked politician, the fat federale who looks like he was typecast as the Mexican in a Hollywood movie from the 1940s. All passably acted but again nothing special.<br /><br />I thought the main villains were pretty well done and fairly well acted. By the end of the movie you certainly knew who the good guys were and weren't. There was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just deserts. Very simplistic, but then you weren't expecting Hamlet, right? The only thing I found really annoying was the constant cuts to VDs daughter during the last fight scene.<br /><br />Not bad. Not good. Passable 4.\nSample prediction with positivity score 0.0002899310493376106:\nits a totally average film with a few semi-alright action sequences that make the plot seem a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam films. parts of the plot don't make sense and seem to be added in to use up time. the end plot is that of a very basic type that doesn't leave the viewer guessing and any twists are obvious from the beginning. the end scene with the flask backs don't make sense as they are added in and seem to have little relevance to the history of van dam's character. not really worth watching again, bit disappointed in the end production, even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget certain shots and sections in the film are of poor directed quality\nSample prediction with positivity score 0.004243704490363598:\nSTAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Former New Orleans homicide cop Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme) is re-assigned to Columbus, a small but violent town in Mexico to help the police there with their efforts to stop a major heroin smuggling operation into their town. The culprits turn out to be ex-military, lead by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, otherwise known as Jase from East Enders) who is using a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight off his opponents. But Jack has a more personal reason for taking him down, that draws the two men into an explosive final showdown where only one will walk away alive.<br /><br />After Until Death, Van Damme appeared to be on a high, showing he could make the best straight to video films in the action market. While that was a far more drama oriented film, with The Shepherd he has returned to the high-kicking, no brainer action that first made him famous and has sadly produced his worst film since Derailed. It's nowhere near as bad as that film, but what I said still stands.<br /><br />A dull, predictable film, with very little in the way of any exciting action. What little there is mainly consists of some limp fight scenes, trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap slo-mo/sped up effects added to them that sadly instead make them look more desperate. Being a Mexican set film, director Isaac Florentine has tried to give the film a Robert Rodriguez/Desperado sort of feel, but this only adds to the desperation.<br /><br />VD gives a particularly uninspired performance and given he's never been a Robert De Niro sort of actor, that can't be good. As the villain, Lord shouldn't expect to leave the beeb anytime soon. He gets little dialogue at the beginning as he struggles to muster an American accent but gets mysteriously better towards the end. All the supporting cast are equally bland, and do nothing to raise the films spirits at all.<br /><br />This is one shepherd that's strayed right from the flock. *\nSample prediction with positivity score 0.996307373046875:\nFirst off let me say, If you haven't enjoyed a Van Damme movie since bloodsport, you probably will not like this movie. Most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but I enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are. This movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys (Segal and Dolph) have thought about putting out the past few years. Van Damme is good in the movie, the movie is only worth watching to Van Damme fans. It is not as good as Wake of Death (which i highly recommend to anyone of likes Van Damme) or In hell but, in my opinion it's worth watching. It has the same type of feel to it as Nowhere to Run. Good fun stuff!\n```\nAfter that, it kicks off the actual batch inference.\nIt should look something like the screenshot below (we are very proud of the progress bar):\n![progress](./batch_inference_progress.png)\nThe whole thing should take a few minutes to run.\n## Further optimization notes\nEvery container downloads the model when it starts, which is a bit inefficient.\nIn order to improve this, what you could do is store the model in the image that\nbacks each container.\nSee [`Image.run_function`](/docs/guide/custom-container#running-a-function-as-a-build-step-beta).\n"}

{"text": "# Run OpenLLaMa on an A100 GPU\nIn this example, we run [OpenLLaMa](https://github.com/openlm-research/open_llama),\nan open-source large language model, using HuggingFace's [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)\nlibrary.\n## Setup\nFirst we import the components we need from `modal`.\n```python\nfrom modal import Image, Stub, gpu, method\n```\n## Define a container image\nTo take advantage of Modal's blazing fast cold-start times, we'll need to download our model weights\ninside our container image.\nTo do this, we have to define a function that loads both the model and tokenizer using\n[from_pretrained](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained).\nSince HuggingFace stores this model into a local cache, when Modal snapshots the image after running this function,\nthe model weights will be saved and available for use when the container starts up next time.\n```python\nBASE_MODEL = \"openlm-research/open_llama_7b\"\ndef download_models():\n    from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer\n    LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(BASE_MODEL)\n    LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained(BASE_MODEL)\n```\nNow, we define our image. We'll use the `debian-slim` base image, and install the dependencies we need\nusing [`pip_install`](/docs/reference/modal.Image#pip_install). At the end, we'll use\n[`run_function`](/docs/guide/custom-container#running-a-function-as-a-build-step-beta) to run the\nfunction defined above as part of the image build.\n```python\nimage = (\n    # Python 3.11+ not yet supported for torch.compile\n    Image.debian_slim(python_version=\"3.10\")\n    .pip_install(\n        \"accelerate~=0.18.0\",\n        \"transformers~=4.28.1\",\n        \"torch~=2.0.0\",\n        \"sentencepiece~=0.1.97\",\n    )\n    .run_function(download_models)\n)\n```\nLet's instantiate and name our [Stub](/docs/guide/apps).\n```python\nstub = Stub(name=\"example-open-llama\", image=image)\n```\n## The model class\nNext, we write the model code. We want Modal to load the model into memory just once every time a container starts up,\nso we use [class syntax](/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) and the `__enter__` method.\nWithin the [@stub.cls](/docs/reference/modal.Stub#cls) decorator, we use the [gpu parameter](/docs/guide/gpu)\nto specify that we want to run our function on an [A100 GPU with 20 GB of VRAM](/pricing).\nThe rest is just using the [generate](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationMixin.generate) function\nfrom the `transformers` library. Refer to the documentation for more parameters and tuning.\n```python\n@stub.cls(gpu=gpu.A100(memory=20))\nclass OpenLlamaModel:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        import torch\n        from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer\n        self.tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained(BASE_MODEL)\n        model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n            BASE_MODEL,\n            torch_dtype=torch.float16,\n            device_map=\"auto\",\n        )\n        self.tokenizer.bos_token_id = 1\n        model.eval()\n        self.model = torch.compile(model)\n        self.device = \"cuda\"\n    @method()\n    def generate(\n        self,\n        input,\n        max_new_tokens=128,\n        **kwargs,\n    ):\n        import torch\n        from transformers import GenerationConfig\n        inputs = self.tokenizer(input, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n        input_ids = inputs[\"input_ids\"].to(self.device)\n        generation_config = GenerationConfig(**kwargs)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            generation_output = self.model.generate(\n                input_ids=input_ids,\n                generation_config=generation_config,\n                return_dict_in_generate=True,\n                output_scores=True,\n                max_new_tokens=max_new_tokens,\n            )\n        s = generation_output.sequences[0]\n        output = self.tokenizer.decode(s)\n        print(f\"\\033[96m{input}\\033[0m\")\n        print(output.split(input)[1].strip())\n```\n## Run the model\nFinally, we define a [`local_entrypoint`](/docs/guide/apps#entrypoints-for-ephemeral-apps) to call our remote function\nsequentially for a list of inputs. You can run this locally with `modal run openllama.py`.\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef main():\n    inputs = [\n        \"Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:\",\n    ]\n    model = OpenLlamaModel()\n    for input in inputs:\n        model.generate.remote(\n            input,\n            top_p=0.75,\n            top_k=40,\n            num_beams=1,\n            temperature=0.1,\n            do_sample=True,\n        )\n```\n## Next steps\nThe above is a simple example of how to run a basic model. Note that OpenLLaMa has not been fine-tuned on an instruction-following dataset,\nso the results aren't amazing out of the box. Refer to [DoppelBot, our Slack fine-tuning demo](https://github.com/modal-labs/doppel-bot) for how\nyou could use OpenLLaMa to perform a more useful downstream task.\nIf you're looking for useful responses out-of-the-box like ChatGPT, you could try Vicuna-13B, which is larger and has been instruction-tuned.\nHowever, note that this model is not permissively licensed due to the dataset it was trained on. Refer to our [LLM voice chat](/docs/guide/llm-voice-chat)\npost for how to build a complete voice chat app using Vicuna, or go straight to the [file](https://github.com/modal-labs/quillman/blob/main/src/llm_vicuna.py)\nif you want to run it by itself.\n"}

{"text": "\n# Stable Diffusion XL 1.0\nThis example is similar to the [Stable Diffusion CLI](/docs/guide/ex/stable_diffusion_cli)\nexample, but it generates images from the larger XL 1.0 model. Specifically, it runs the\nfirst set of steps with the base model, followed by the refiner model.\n[Try out the live demo here!](https://modal-labs--stable-diffusion-xl-app.modal.run/) The first\ngeneration may include a cold-start, which takes around 20 seconds. The inference speed depends on the GPU\nand step count (for reference, an A100 runs 40 steps in 8 seconds).\n## Basic setup\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom modal import Image, Mount, Stub, asgi_app, gpu, method\n```\n## Define a container image\nTo take advantage of Modal's blazing fast cold-start times, we'll need to download our model weights\ninside our container image with a download function. We ignore binaries, ONNX weights and 32-bit weights.\nTip: avoid using global variables in this function to ensure the download step detects model changes and\ntriggers a rebuild.\n```python\ndef download_models():\n    from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\n    ignore = [\"*.bin\", \"*.onnx_data\", \"*/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors\"]\n    snapshot_download(\n        \"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0\", ignore_patterns=ignore\n    )\n    snapshot_download(\n        \"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0\", ignore_patterns=ignore\n    )\nimage = (\n    Image.debian_slim()\n    .apt_install(\n        \"libglib2.0-0\", \"libsm6\", \"libxrender1\", \"libxext6\", \"ffmpeg\", \"libgl1\"\n    )\n    .pip_install(\n        \"diffusers~=0.19\",\n        \"invisible_watermark~=0.1\",\n        \"transformers~=4.31\",\n        \"accelerate~=0.21\",\n        \"safetensors~=0.3\",\n    )\n    .run_function(download_models)\n)\nstub = Stub(\"stable-diffusion-xl\", image=image)\n```\n## Load model and run inference\nThe container lifecycle [`__enter__` function](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions#container-lifecycle-beta)\nloads the model at startup. Then, we evaluate it in the `run_inference` function.\nTo avoid excessive cold-starts, we set the idle timeout to 240 seconds, meaning once a GPU has loaded the model it will stay\nonline for 4 minutes before spinning down. This can be adjusted for cost/experience trade-offs.\n```python\n@stub.cls(gpu=gpu.A10G(), container_idle_timeout=240)\nclass Model:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        import torch\n        from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\n        load_options = dict(\n            torch_dtype=torch.float16,\n            use_safetensors=True,\n            variant=\"fp16\",\n            device_map=\"auto\",\n        )\n        # Load base model\n        self.base = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n            \"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0\", **load_options\n        )\n        # Load refiner model\n        self.refiner = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n            \"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0\",\n            text_encoder_2=self.base.text_encoder_2,\n            vae=self.base.vae,\n            **load_options,\n        )\n        # These suggested compile commands actually increase inference time, but may be mis-used.\n        # self.base.unet = torch.compile(self.base.unet, mode=\"reduce-overhead\", fullgraph=True)\n        # self.refiner.unet = torch.compile(self.refiner.unet, mode=\"reduce-overhead\", fullgraph=True)\n    @method()\n    def inference(self, prompt, n_steps=24, high_noise_frac=0.8):\n        negative_prompt = \"disfigured, ugly, deformed\"\n        image = self.base(\n            prompt=prompt,\n            negative_prompt=negative_prompt,\n            num_inference_steps=n_steps,\n            denoising_end=high_noise_frac,\n            output_type=\"latent\",\n        ).images\n        image = self.refiner(\n            prompt=prompt,\n            negative_prompt=negative_prompt,\n            num_inference_steps=n_steps,\n            denoising_start=high_noise_frac,\n            image=image,\n        ).images[0]\n        import io\n        byte_stream = io.BytesIO()\n        image.save(byte_stream, format=\"PNG\")\n        image_bytes = byte_stream.getvalue()\n        return image_bytes\n```\nAnd this is our entrypoint; where the CLI is invoked.

We run this in Modal, although you could also run it locally.\nNote that the plotting code calls the other two functions.\nSince we plot the data in the cloud, we can't display it, so we generate a PNG\nand return the binary content from the function.\n```python\n@stub.function()\ndef plot_stocks():\n    from matplotlib import pyplot, ticker\n    # Setup\n    pyplot.style.use(\"ggplot\")\n    fig, ax = pyplot.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))\n    # Get data\n    tickers = list(get_stocks.remote_gen())\n    if not tickers:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Retrieved zero stock tickers!\")\n    data = list(get_prices.map(tickers))\n    first_date = min((min(prices.keys()) for symbol, prices in data if prices))\n    last_date = max((max(prices.keys()) for symbol, prices in data if prices))\n    # Plot every symbol\n    for symbol, prices in data:\n        if len(prices) == 0:\n            continue\n        dates = list(sorted(prices.keys()))\n        prices = list(prices[date] for date in dates)\n        changes = [\n            100.0 * (price / prices[0] - 1) for price in prices\n        ]  # Normalize to initial price\n        if changes[-1] > 20:\n            # Highlight this line\n            p = ax.plot(dates, changes, alpha=0.7)\n            ax.annotate(\n                symbol,\n                (last_date, changes[-1]),\n                ha=\"left\",\n                va=\"center\",\n                color=p[0].get_color(),\n                alpha=0.7,\n            )\n        else:\n            ax.plot(dates, changes, color=\"gray\", alpha=0.2)\n    # Configure axes and title\n    ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(ticker.PercentFormatter())\n    ax.set_title(f\"Best ETFs {first_date.date()} - {last_date.date()}\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(f\"% change, {first_date.date()} = 0%\")\n    # Dump the chart to .png and return the bytes\n    with io.BytesIO() as buf:\n        pyplot.savefig(buf, format=\"png\", dpi=300)\n        return buf.getvalue()\n```\n## Entrypoint\nThe entrypoint locally runs the app, gets the chart back as a PNG file, and\nsaves it to disk.\n```python\nOUTPUT_DIR = \"/tmp/\"\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef main():\n    os.makedirs(OUTPUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)\n    data = plot_stocks.remote()\n    filename = os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, \"stock_prices.png\")\n    print(f\"saving data to {filename}\")\n    with open(filename, \"wb\") as f:\n        f.write(data)\n```\n"}
{"text": "# Run Falcon-40B with AutoGPTQ\nIn this example, we run a quantized 4-bit version of Falcon-40B, the first open-source large language\nmodel of its size, using HuggingFace's [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)\nlibrary and [AutoGPTQ](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ).\nDue to the current limitations of the library, the inference speed is a little under 1 token/second and the\ncold start time on Modal is around 25s.\nFor faster inference at the expense of a slower cold start, check out\n[Running Falcon-40B with `bitsandbytes` quantization](/docs/guide/ex/falcon_bitsandbytes). You can also\nrun a smaller, 7-billion-parameter model with the [OpenLLaMa example](/docs/guide/ex/openllama).\n## Setup\nFirst we import the components we need from `modal`.\n```python\nfrom modal import Image, Stub, gpu, method, web_endpoint\n```\n## Define a container image\nTo take advantage of Modal's blazing fast cold-start times, we download model weights\ninto a folder inside our container image. These weights come from a quantized model\nfound on Huggingface.\n```python\nIMAGE_MODEL_DIR = \"/model\"\ndef download_model():\n    from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\n    model_name = \"TheBloke/falcon-40b-instruct-GPTQ\"\n    snapshot_download(model_name, local_dir=IMAGE_MODEL_DIR)\n```\nNow, we define our image. We'll use the `debian-slim` base image, and install the dependencies we need\nusing [`pip_install`](/docs/reference/modal.Image#pip_install). At the end, we'll use\n[`run_function`](/docs/guide/custom-container#running-a-function-as-a-build-step-beta) to run the\nfunction defined above as part of the image build.\n```python\nimage = (\n    Image.debian_slim(python_version=\"3.10\")\n    .apt_install(\"git\")\n    .pip_install(\n        \"auto-gptq @ git+https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ.git@b5db750c00e5f3f195382068433a3408ec3e8f3c\",\n        \"einops==0.6.1\",\n        \"hf-transfer~=0.1\",\n        \"huggingface_hub==0.14.1\",\n        \"transformers @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git@f49a3453caa6fe606bb31c571423f72264152fce\",\n    )\n    # Use huggingface's hi-perf hf-transfer library to download this large model.\n    .env({\"HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER\": \"1\"})\n    .run_function(download_model)\n)\n```\nLet's instantiate and name our [Stub](/docs/guide/apps).\n```python\nstub = Stub(name=\"example-falcon-gptq\", image=image)\n```\n## The model class\nNext, we write the model code. We want Modal to load the model into memory just once every time a container starts up,\nso we use [class syntax](/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) and the `__enter__` method.\nWithin the [@stub.cls](/docs/reference/modal.Stub#cls) decorator, we use the [gpu parameter](/docs/guide/gpu)\nto specify that we want to run our function on an [A100 GPU](/pricing). We also allow each call 10 mintues to complete,\nand request the runner to stay live for 5 minutes after its last request.\nThe rest is just using the `transformers` library to run the model. Refer to the\n[documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.29.1/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationMixin.generate)\nfor more parameters and tuning.\nNote that we need to create a separate thread to call the `generate` function because we need to\nyield the text back from the streamer in the main thread. This is an idiosyncrasy with streaming in `transformers`.\n```python\n@stub.cls(gpu=gpu.A100(), timeout=60 * 10, container_idle_timeout=60 * 5)\nclass Falcon40BGPTQ:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        from auto_gptq import AutoGPTQForCausalLM\n        from transformers import AutoTokenizer\n        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\n            IMAGE_MODEL_DIR, use_fast=True\n        )\n        print(\"Loaded tokenizer.\")\n        self.model = AutoGPTQForCausalLM.from_quantized(\n            IMAGE_MODEL_DIR,\n            trust_remote_code=True,\n            use_safetensors=True,\n            device_map=\"auto\",\n            use_triton=False,\n            strict=False,\n        )\n        print(\"Loaded model.\")\n    @method()\n    def generate(self, prompt: str):\n        from threading import Thread\n        from transformers import TextIteratorStreamer\n        inputs = self.tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n        streamer = TextIteratorStreamer(\n            self.tokenizer, skip_special_tokens=True\n        )\n        generation_kwargs = dict(\n            inputs=inputs.input_ids.cuda(),\n            attention_mask=inputs.attention_mask,\n            temperature=0.1,\n            max_new_tokens=512,\n            streamer=streamer,\n        )\n        # Run generation on separate thread to enable response streaming.\n        thread = Thread(target=self.model.generate, kwargs=generation_kwargs)\n        thread.start()\n        for new_text in streamer:\n            yield new_text\n        thread.join()\n```\n## Run the model\nWe define a [`local_entrypoint`](/docs/guide/apps#entrypoints-for-ephemeral-apps) to call our remote function\nsequentially for a list of inputs. You can run this locally with `modal run -q falcon_gptq.py`. The `-q` flag\nenables streaming to work in the terminal output.\n```python\nprompt_template = (\n    \"A chat between a curious human user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant give a helpful, detailed, and accurate answer to the user's question.\"\n    \"\\n\\nUser:\\n{}\\n\\nAssistant:\\n\"\n)\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef cli():\n    question = \"What are the main differences between Python and JavaScript programming languages?\"\n    model = Falcon40BGPTQ()\n    for text in model.generate.remote_gen(prompt_template.format(question)):\n        print(text, end=\"\", flush=True)\n```\n## Serve the model\nFinally, we can serve the model from a web endpoint with `modal deploy falcon_gptq.py`. If\nyou visit the resulting URL with a question parameter in your URL, you can view the model's\nstream back a response.\nYou can try our deployment [here](https://modal-labs--example-falcon-gptq-get.modal.run/?question=Why%20are%20manhole%20covers%20round?).\n```python\n@stub.function(timeout=60 * 10)\n@web_endpoint()\ndef get(question: str):\n    from itertools import chain\n    from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse\n    model = Falcon40BGPTQ()\n    return StreamingResponse(\n        chain(\n            (\"Loading model.

{"text": "\n# Document OCR job queue\nThis tutorial shows you how to use Modal as an infinitely scalable job queue\nthat can service async tasks from a web app. For the purpose of this tutorial,\nwe've also built a [React + FastAPI web app on Modal](/docs/guide/ex/doc_ocr_webapp)\nthat works together with it, but note that you don't need a web app running on Modal\nto use this pattern. You can submit async tasks to Modal from any Python\napplication (for example, a regular Django app running on Kubernetes).\nOur job queue will handle a single task: running OCR transcription for images.\nWe'll make use of a pre-trained Document Understanding model using the\n[donut](https://github.com/clovaai/donut) package to accomplish this. Try\nit out for yourself [here](https://modal-labs-example-doc-ocr-webapp-wrapper.modal.run/).\n![receipt parser frontend](./receipt_parser_frontend_2.jpg)\n## Define a Stub\nLet's first import `modal` and define a [`Stub`](/docs/reference/modal.Stub). Later, we'll use the name provided\nfor our `Stub` to find it from our web app, and submit tasks to it.\n```python\nimport urllib.request\nimport modal\nstub = modal.Stub(\"example-doc-ocr-jobs\")\n```\n## Model cache\n`donut` downloads the weights for pre-trained models to a local directory, if those weights don't already exist.\nTo decrease start-up time, we want this download to happen just once, even across separate function invocations.\nTo accomplish this, we use the [`Image.run_function`](/docs/reference/modal.Image#run_function) method, which allows\nus to run some code at image build time to save the model weights into the image.\n```python\nCACHE_PATH = \"/root/model_cache\"\nMODEL_NAME = \"naver-clova-ix/donut-base-finetuned-cord-v2\"\ndef download_model_weights() -> None:\n    from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\n    snapshot_download(repo_id=MODEL_NAME, cache_dir=CACHE_PATH)\nimage = (\n    modal.Image.debian_slim()\n    .pip_install(\n        \"donut-python==1.0.7\",\n        \"huggingface-hub==0.16.4\",\n        \"transformers==4.21.3\",\n        \"timm==0.5.4\",\n    )\n    .run_function(download_model_weights)\n)\n```\n## Handler function\nNow let's define our handler function. Using the [@stub.function()](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Stub#function)\ndecorator, we set up a Modal [Function](/docs/reference/modal.Function) that uses GPUs,\nruns on a [custom container image](/docs/guide/custom-container),\nand automatically [retries](/docs/guide/retries#function-retries) failures up to 3 times.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    gpu=\"any\",\n    image=image,\n    retries=3,\n)\ndef parse_receipt(image: bytes):\n    import io\n    import torch\n    from donut import DonutModel\n    from PIL import Image\n    # Use donut fine-tuned on an OCR dataset.\n    task_prompt = \"<s_cord-v2>\"\n    pretrained_model = DonutModel.from_pretrained(\n        MODEL_NAME,\n        cache_dir=CACHE_PATH,\n    )\n    # Initialize model.\n    pretrained_model.half()\n    device = torch.device(\"cuda\")\n    pretrained_model.to(device)\n    # Run inference.\n    input_img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image))\n    output = pretrained_model.inference(image=input_img, prompt=task_prompt)[\n        \"predictions\"\n    ][0]\n    print(\"Result: \", output)\n    return output\n```\n## Deploy\nNow that we have a function, we can publish it by deploying the app:\n```shell\nmodal deploy doc_ocr_jobs.py\n```\nOnce it's published, we can [look up](/docs/guide/trigger-deployed-functions) this function from another\nPython process and submit tasks to it:\n```python\nfn = modal.Function.lookup(\"example-doc-ocr-jobs\", \"parse_receipt\")\nfn.spawn(my_image)\n```\nModal will auto-scale to handle all the tasks queued, and\nthen scale back down to 0 when there's no work left. To see how you could use this from a Python web\napp, take a look at the [receipt parser frontend](/docs/guide/ex/doc_ocr_webapp)\ntutorial.\n## Run manually\nWe can also trigger `parse_receipt` manually for easier debugging:\n`modal run doc_ocr_jobs::stub.main`\nTo try it out, you can find some\nexample receipts [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S2D1gXd4YIft4a5wDtW99jfl38e85ouW).\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef main():\n    from pathlib import Path\n    receipt_filename = Path(__file__).parent / \"receipt.png\"\n    if receipt_filename.exists():\n        with open(receipt_filename, \"rb\") as f:\n            image = f.read()\n    else:\n        image = urllib.request.urlopen(\n            \"https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brandys-walmart-receipt-8.webp\"\n        ).read()\n    print(parse_receipt.remote(image))\n```\n"}

On\nthe largest 70B model, the 135GB model can be loaded in as little as 70 seconds.\n### Download the weights\nWe can use the included utilities to download the model weights (and convert to safetensors, if necessary)\nas part of the image build.\n```python\ndef download_model():\n    import subprocess\n    subprocess.run([\"text-generation-server\", \"download-weights\", MODEL_ID])\n```\n### Image definition\nWe\u2019ll start from a Dockerhub image recommended by TGI, and override the default `ENTRYPOINT` for\nModal to run its own which enables seamless serverless deployments.\nNext we run the download step to pre-populate the image with our model weights.\nFor this step to work on a gated model such as LLaMA 2, the HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN environment\nvariable must be set ([reference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference#using-a-private-or-gated-model)).\nAfter [creating a HuggingFace access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens),\nhead to the [secrets page](https://modal.com/secrets) to create a Modal secret.\nThe key should be `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` and the value should be your access token.\nFinally, we install the `text-generation` client to interface with TGI's Rust webserver over `localhost`.\n```python\nimage = (\n    Image.from_registry(\"ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:1.0.3\")\n    .dockerfile_commands(\"ENTRYPOINT []\")\n    .run_function(download_model, secret=Secret.from_name(\"huggingface\"))\n    .pip_install(\"text-generation\")\n)\nstub = Stub(\"example-tgi-\" + MODEL_ID.split(\"/\")[-1], image=image)\n```\n## The model class\nThe inference function is best represented with Modal's [class syntax](/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions).\nThe class syntax is a special representation for a Modal function which splits logic into two parts:\n1. the `__enter__` method, which runs once per container when it starts up, and\n2. the `@method()` function, which runs per inference request.\nThis means the model is loaded into the GPUs, and the backend for TGI is launched just once when each\ncontainer starts, and this state is cached for each subsequent invocation of the function.\nNote that on start-up, we must wait for the Rust webserver to accept connections before considering the\ncontainer ready.\nHere, we also\n- specify the secret so the `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` environment variable is set\n- specify how many A100s we need per container\n- specify that each container is allowed to handle up to 10 inputs (i.e. requests) simultaneously\n- keep idle containers for 10 minutes before spinning down\n- lift the timeout of each request.\n```python\n@stub.cls(\n    secret=Secret.from_name(\"huggingface\"),\n    gpu=GPU_CONFIG,\n    allow_concurrent_inputs=10,\n    container_idle_timeout=60 * 10,\n    timeout=60 * 60,\n)\nclass Model:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        import socket\n        import subprocess\n        import time\n        from text_generation import AsyncClient\n        self.launcher = subprocess.Popen(\n            [\"text-generation-launcher\"] + LAUNCH_FLAGS\n        )\n        self.client = AsyncClient(\"http://0.0.0.0:80\", timeout=60)\n        self.template = \"\"\"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\n{system}\n<</SYS>>\n{user} [/INST] \"\"\"\n        # Poll until webserver at 0.0.0.0:80 accepts connections before running inputs.\n        def webserver_ready():\n            try:\n                socket.create_connection((\"0.0.0.0\", 80), timeout=1).close()\n                return True\n            except (socket.timeout, ConnectionRefusedError):\n                return False\n        while not webserver_ready():\n            time.sleep(1.0)\n        print(\"Webserver ready!\")\n    def __exit__(self, _exc_type, _exc_value, _traceback):\n        self.launcher.terminate()\n    @method()\n    async def generate(self, question: str):\n        prompt = self.template.format(system=\"\", user=question)\n        result = await self.client.generate(prompt, max_new_tokens=1024)\n        return result.generated_text\n    @method()\n    async def generate_stream(self, question: str):\n        prompt = self.template.format(system=\"\", user=question)\n        async for response in self.client.generate_stream(\n            prompt, max_new_tokens=1024\n        ):\n            if not response.token.special:\n                yield response.token.text\n```\n## Run the model\nWe define a [`local_entrypoint`](/docs/guide/apps#entrypoints-for-ephemeral-apps) to invoke\nour remote function.

{"text": "# News article summarizer\nIn this example we scrape news articles from the [New York Times'\nScience section](https://www.nytimes.com/section/science) and summarize them\nusing Google's deep learning summarization model [Pegasus](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/pegasus-state-of-art-model-for.html).\nWe log the resulting summaries to the terminal, but you can do whatever you want with the\nsummaries afterwards: saving to a CSV file, sending to Slack, etc.\n```python\nimport os\nimport re\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import List\nimport modal\nstub = modal.Stub(name=\"example-news-summarizer\")\n```\n## Building Images and Downloading Pre-trained Model\nWe start by defining our images. In Modal, each function can use a different\nimage. This is powerful because you add only the dependencies you need for\neach function.\nThe first image contains dependencies for running our model. We also download the\npre-trained model into the image using the `from_pretrained` method.\nThis caches the model so that we don't have to download it on every function call.\nThe model will be saved at `/cache` when this function is called at image build time;\nsubsequent calls of this function at runtime will then load the model from `/cache`.\n```python\ndef fetch_model(local_files_only: bool = False):\n    from transformers import PegasusForConditionalGeneration, PegasusTokenizer\n    tokenizer = PegasusTokenizer.from_pretrained(\n        \"google/pegasus-xsum\",\n        cache_dir=\"/cache\",\n        local_files_only=local_files_only,\n    )\n    model = PegasusForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\n        \"google/pegasus-xsum\",\n        cache_dir=\"/cache\",\n        local_files_only=local_files_only,\n    )\n    return model, tokenizer\nstub[\"deep_learning_image\"] = (\n    modal.Image.debian_slim()\n    .pip_install(\"transformers==4.16.2\", \"torch\", \"sentencepiece\")\n    .run_function(fetch_model)\n)\n```\nDefining the scraping image is very similar. This image only contains the packages required\nto scrape the New York Times website, though; so it's much smaller.\n```python\nstub[\"scraping_image\"] = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\n    \"requests\", \"beautifulsoup4\", \"lxml\"\n)\nif stub.is_inside(stub[\"scraping_image\"]):\n    import requests\n    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n```\n## Collect Data\nCollecting data happens in two stages: first a list of URL articles\nusing the NYT API then scrape the NYT web page for each of those articles\nto collect article texts.\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass NYArticle:\n    title: str\n    image_url: str = \"\"\n    url: str = \"\"\n    summary: str = \"\"\n    text: str = \"\"\n```\nIn order to connect to the NYT API, you will need to sign up at [NYT Developer Portal](https://developer.nytimes.com/),\ncreate an Stub then grab an API key. Then head to Modal and create a [Secret](https://modal.com/docs/guide/secrets) called `nytimes`.\nCreate an environment variable called `NYTIMES_API_KEY` with your API key.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    secret=modal.Secret.from_name(\"nytimes\"), image=stub[\"scraping_image\"]\n)\ndef latest_science_stories(n_stories: int = 5) -> List[NYArticle]:\n    # query api for latest science articles\n    params = {\n        \"api-key\": os.environ[\"NYTIMES_API_KEY\"],\n    }\n    nyt_api_url = \"https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/science.json\"\n    response = requests.get(nyt_api_url, params=params)\n    # extract data from articles and return list of NYArticle objects\n    results = response.json()\n    reject_urls = {\"null\", \"\", None}\n    articles = [\n        NYArticle(\n            title=u[\"title\"],\n            image_url=u.get(\"multimedia\")[0][\"url\"]\n            if u.get(\"multimedia\")\n            else \"\",\n            url=u.get(\"url\"),\n        )\n        for u in results[\"results\"]\n        if u.get(\"url\") not in reject_urls\n    ]\n    # select only a handful of articles; this usually returns 25 articles\n    articles = articles[:n_stories]\n    print(f\"Retrieved {len(articles)} from the NYT Top Stories API\")\n    return articles\n```\nThe NYT API only gives us article URLs but it doesn't include the article text. We'll get the article URLs\nfrom the API then scrape each URL for the article body. We'll be using\n[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) for that.\n```python\n@stub.function(image=stub[\"scraping_image\"])\ndef scrape_nyc_article(url: str) -> str:\n    print(f\"Scraping article => {url}\")\n    # fetch article; simulate desktop browser\n    headers = {\n        \"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_2) AppleWebKit/601.3.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/9.0.2 Safari/601.3.9\"\n    }\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, \"lxml\")\n    # get all text paragraphs & construct single string with article text\n    article_text = \"\"\n    article_section = soup.find_all(\n        \"div\", {\"class\": re.compile(r\"\\bStoryBodyCompanionColumn\\b\")}\n    )\n    if article_section:\n        paragraph_tags = article_section[0].find_all(\"p\")\n        article_text = \" \".join([p.get_text() for p in paragraph_tags])\n    # return article with scraped text\n    return article_text\n```\nNow the summarization function. We use `huggingface`'s Pegasus tokenizer and model implementation to\ngenerate a summary of the model. You can learn more about Pegasus does in the [HuggingFace\ndocumentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/pegasus). Use `gpu=\"any\"` to speed-up inference.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    image=stub[\"deep_learning_image\"],\n    gpu=False,\n    memory=4096,\n)\ndef summarize_article(text: str) -> str:\n    print(f\"Summarizing text with {len(text)} characters.\")\n    # `local_files_only` is set to `True` because we expect to read the model\n    # files saved in the image.\n    model, tokenizer = fetch_model(local_files_only=True)\n    # summarize text\n    batch = tokenizer(\n        [text], truncation=True, padding=\"longest\", return_tensors=\"pt\"\n    ).to(\"cpu\")\n    translated = model.generate(**batch)\n    summary = tokenizer.batch_decode(translated, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\n    return summary\n```\n## Create a Scheduled Function\nPut everything together and schedule it to run every day. You can also use `modal.Cron` for a\nmore advanced scheduling interface.\n```python\n@stub.function(schedule=modal.Period(days=1))\ndef trigger():\n    articles = latest_science_stories.remote()\n    # parallelize article scraping\n    for i, text in enumerate(scrape_nyc_article.map([a.url for a in articles])):\n        articles[i].text = text\n    # parallelize summarization\n    for i, summary in enumerate(\n        summarize_article.map([a.text for a in articles if len(a.text) > 0])\n    ):\n        articles[i].summary = summary\n    # show all summaries in the terminal\n    for article in articles:\n        print(f'Summary of \"{article.title}\" => {article.summary}')\n```\nCreate a new Modal scheduled function with:\n```shell\nmodal deploy --name news_summarizer news_summarizer.py\n```\nYou can also run this entire Modal app in debugging mode before.\ncall it with `modal run news_summarizer.py`\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef main():\n    trigger.remote()\n```\nAnd that's it. You will now generate deep learning summaries from the latest\nNYT Science articles every day.\n"}

way, we're ready to create an SQLite DB and feed data into it.\nImportantly, the `prep_db` function mounts the same network file system used by `download_dataset()`, and\nrows are batch inserted with progress logged after each batch, as the full COVID-19 has millions\nof rows and does take some time to be fully inserted.\nA more sophisticated implementation would only load new data instead of performing a full refresh,\nbut for this example things are kept simple.\n```python\ndef chunks(it, size):\n    import itertools\n    return iter(lambda: tuple(itertools.islice(it, size)), ())\n@stub.function(\n    image=datasette_image,\n    network_file_systems={CACHE_DIR: volume},\n    timeout=900,\n)\ndef prep_db():\n    import sqlite_utils\n    from flufl.lock import Lock\n    print(\"Loading daily reports...\")\n    records = load_daily_reports()\n    with Lock(\n        LOCK_FILE,\n        lifetime=timedelta(minutes=2),\n        default_timeout=timedelta(hours=1),\n    ) as lck, tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as tmp:\n        db = sqlite_utils.Database(tmp.name)\n        table = db[\"johns_hopkins_csse_daily_reports\"]\n        batch_size = 100_000\n        for i, batch in enumerate(chunks(records, size=batch_size)):\n            truncate = True if i == 0 else False\n            table.insert_all(batch, batch_size=batch_size, truncate=truncate)\n            lck.refresh()\n            print(f\"Inserted {len(batch)} rows into DB.\")\n        table.create_index([\"day\"], if_not_exists=True)\n        table.create_index([\"province_or_state\"], if_not_exists=True)\n        table.create_index([\"country_or_region\"], if_not_exists=True)\n        print(\"Syncing DB with network volume.\")\n        DB_PATH.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n        shutil.copyfile(tmp.name, DB_PATH)\n```\n## Keeping fresh\nJohns Hopkins commits new data to the dataset repository every day, so we\nsetup a [scheduled](/docs/guide/cron) Modal function to run automatically once every 24 hours.\n```python\n@stub.function(schedule=Period(hours=24), timeout=1000)\ndef refresh_db():\n    print(f\"Running scheduled refresh at {datetime.now()}\")\n    download_dataset.remote(cache=False)\n    prep_db.remote()\n```\n## Webhook\nHooking up the SQLite database to a Modal webhook is as simple as it gets.\nThe Modal `@stub.asgi_app` decorator wraps a few lines of code: one `import` and a few\nlines to instantiate the `Datasette` instance and return a reference to its ASGI app object.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    image=datasette_image,\n    network_file_systems={CACHE_DIR: volume},\n)\n@asgi_app()\ndef app():\n    from datasette.app import Datasette\n    ds = Datasette(files=[DB_PATH])\n    asyncio.run(ds.invoke_startup())\n    return ds.app()\n```\n## Publishing to the web\nRun this script using `modal run covid_datasette.py` and it will create the database.\nYou can run this script using `modal serve covid_datasette.py` and it will create a\nshort-lived web URL that exists until you terminate the script.\nWhen publishing the interactive Datasette app you'll want to create a persistent URL.\nThis is achieved by deploying the script with `modal deploy covid_datasette.py`.\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef run():\n    print(\"Downloading COVID-19 dataset...\")\n    download_dataset.remote()\n    print(\"Prepping SQLite DB...\")\n    prep_db.remote()\n```\nYou can go explore the data over at

{"text": "\n# Run Falcon-40B with bitsandbytes\nIn this example, we download the full-precision weights of the Falcon-40B LLM but load it in 4-bit using\nTim Dettmer's [`bitsandbytes`](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes) library. This enables it to fit\ninto a single GPU (A100 40GB).\nDue to the current limitations of the library, the inference speed is a little over 2 tokens/second and due\nto the sheer size of the model, the cold start time on Modal is around 2 minutes.\nFor faster cold start at the expense of inference speed, check out\n[Running Falcon-40B with AutoGPTQ](/docs/guide/ex/falcon_gptq).\n## Setup\nFirst we import the components we need from `modal`.\n```python\nfrom modal import Image, Stub, gpu, method, web_endpoint\n```\nSpec for an image where falcon-40b-instruct is cached locally\n```python\ndef download_falcon_40b():\n    from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\n    model_name = \"tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct\"\n    snapshot_download(model_name)\nimage = (\n    Image.micromamba()\n    .micromamba_install(\n        \"cudatoolkit=11.7\",\n        \"cudnn=8.1.0\",\n        \"cuda-nvcc\",\n        \"scipy\",\n        channels=[\"conda-forge\", \"nvidia\"],\n    )\n    .apt_install(\"git\")\n    .pip_install(\n        \"bitsandbytes==0.39.0\",\n        \"bitsandbytes-cuda117==0.26.0.post2\",\n        \"peft @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/peft.git\",\n        \"transformers @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\",\n        \"accelerate @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate.git\",\n        \"hf-transfer~=0.1\",\n        \"torch==2.0.0\",\n        \"torchvision==0.15.1\",\n        \"sentencepiece==0.1.97\",\n        \"huggingface_hub==0.14.1\",\n        \"einops==0.6.1\",\n    )\n    # Use huggingface's hi-perf hf-transfer library to download this large model.\n    .env({\"HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER\": \"1\"})\n    .run_function(download_falcon_40b)\n)\nstub = Stub(image=image, name=\"example-falcon-bnb\")\n```\n## The model class\nNext, we write the model code. We want Modal to load the model into memory just once every time a container starts up,\nso we use [class syntax](/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) and the __enter__` method.\nWithin the [@stub.cls](/docs/reference/modal.Stub#cls) decorator, we use the [gpu parameter](/docs/guide/gpu)\nto specify that we want to run our function on an [A100 GPU](/pricing). We also allow each call 10 mintues to complete,\nand request the runner to stay live for 5 minutes after its last request.\nWe load the model in 4-bit using the `bitsandbytes` library.\nThe rest is just using the [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines)\nabstraction from the `transformers` library. Refer to the documentation for more parameters and tuning.\n```python\n@stub.cls(\n    gpu=gpu.A100(),  # Use A100s\n    timeout=60 * 10,  # 10 minute timeout on inputs\n    container_idle_timeout=60 * 5,  # Keep runner alive for 5 minutes\n)\nclass Falcon40B_4bit:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        import torch\n        from transformers import (\n            AutoModelForCausalLM,\n            AutoTokenizer,\n            BitsAndBytesConfig,\n        )\n        model_name = \"tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct\"\n        nf4_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(\n            load_in_4bit=True,\n            bnb_4bit_quant_type=\"nf4\",\n            bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=False,\n            bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n        )\n        model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n            model_name,\n            trust_remote_code=True,\n            local_files_only=True,  # Model is downloaded to cache dir\n            device_map=\"auto\",\n            quantization_config=nf4_config,\n        )\n        model.eval()\n        tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\n            model_name,\n            trust_remote_code=True,\n            local_files_only=True,\n            device_map=\"auto\",\n        )\n        tokenizer.bos_token_id = 1\n        self.model = torch.compile(model)\n        self.tokenizer = tokenizer\n    @method()\n    def generate(self, prompt: str):\n        from threading import Thread\n        from transformers import GenerationConfig, TextIteratorStreamer\n        tokenized = self.tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n        input_ids = tokenized.input_ids\n        input_ids = input_ids.to(self.model.device)\n        generation_config = GenerationConfig(\n            do_sample=True,\n            temperature=0.1,\n            max_new_tokens=512,\n        )\n        streamer = TextIteratorStreamer(\n            self.tokenizer, skip_special_tokens=True\n        )\n        generate_kwargs = dict(\n            input_ids=input_ids,\n            generation_config=generation_config,\n            return_dict_in_generate=True,\n            eos_token_id=self.tokenizer.eos_token_id,\n            pad_token_id=self.tokenizer.eos_token_id,\n            bos_token_id=self.tokenizer.bos_token_id,\n            attention_mask=tokenized.attention_mask,\n            output_scores=True,\n            streamer=streamer,\n        )\n        thread = Thread(target=self.model.generate, kwargs=generate_kwargs)\n        thread.start()\n        for new_text in streamer:\n            print(new_text, end=\"\")\n            yield new_text\n        thread.join()\n```\n## Run the model\nWe define a [`local_entrypoint`](/docs/guide/apps#entrypoints-for-ephemeral-apps) to call our remote function\nsequentially for a list of inputs. You can run this locally with `modal run -q falcon_bitsandbytes.py`. The `-q` flag\nenables streaming to work in the terminal output.\n```python\nprompt_template = (\n    \"A chat between a curious human user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant give a helpful, detailed, and accurate answer to the user's question.\"\n    \"\\n\\nUser:\\n{}\\n\\nAssistant:\\n\"\n)\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef cli(prompt: str = None):\n    question = (\n        prompt\n        or \"What are the main differences between Python and JavaScript programming languages?\"\n    )\n    model = Falcon40B_4bit()\n    for text in model.generate.remote_gen(prompt_template.format(question)):\n        print(text, end=\"\", flush=True)\n```\n## Serve the model\nFinally, we can serve the model from a web endpoint with `modal deploy falcon_bitsandbytes.py`. If\nyou visit the resulting URL with a question parameter in your URL, you can view the model's\nstream back a response.\nYou can try our deployment [here](https://modal-labs--example-falcon-bnb-get.modal.run/?question=How%20do%20planes%20work?).\n```python\n@stub.function(timeout=60 * 10)\n@web_endpoint()\ndef get(question: str):\n    from itertools import chain\n    from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse\n    model = Falcon40B_4bit()\n    return StreamingResponse(\n        chain(\n            (\"Loading model (100GB).

We also time this. Note that the first time we run this,\nit will build the image. This might take 1-2 min. When we run this subsequent times, the image\nis already build, and it will run much much faster.\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    t0 = time.time()\n    with stub.run():\n        t = fit.remote()\n        print(\"Function time spent:\", t)\n    print(\"Full time spent:\", time.time() - t0)\n```\n"}

{"text": "# Fast inference with vLLM (Llama 2 13B)\nIn this example, we show how to run basic inference, using [`vLLM`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)\nto take advantage of PagedAttention, which speeds up sequential inferences with optimized key-value caching.\n`vLLM` also supports a use case as a FastAPI server which we will explore in a future guide. This example\nwalks through setting up an environment that works with `vLLM ` for basic inference.\nWe are running the Llama 2 13B model here, and you can expect 30 second cold starts and well over 100 tokens/second.\nThe larger the batch of prompts, the higher the throughput. For example, with the 60 prompts below,\nwe can produce 24k tokens in 39 seconds, which is around 600 tokens/second.\nTo run\n[any of the other supported models](https://vllm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/supported_models.html),\nsimply replace the model name in the download step. You may also need to enable `trust_remote_code` for MPT models (see comment below)..\n## Setup\nFirst we import the components we need from `modal`.\n```python\nimport os\nfrom modal import Image, Secret, Stub, method\n```\n## Define a container image\nWe want to create a Modal image which has the model weights pre-saved to a directory. The benefit of this\nis that the container no longer has to re-download the model from Huggingface - instead, it will take\nadvantage of Modal's internal filesystem for faster cold starts.\n### Download the weights\nSince the weights are gated on HuggingFace, we must request access in two places:\n- on the [model card page](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf)\n- accept the license [on the Meta website](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/).\nNext, [create a HuggingFace access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).\nTo access the token in a Modal function, we can create a secret on the [secrets page](https://modal.com/secrets).\nNow the token will be available via the environment variable named `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`. Functions that inject this secret will have access to the environment variable.\nWe can download the model to a particular directory using the HuggingFace utility function `snapshot_download`.\nTip: avoid using global variables in this function. Changes to code outside this function will not be detected and the download step will not re-run.\n```python\ndef download_model_to_folder():\n    from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\n    snapshot_download(\n        \"meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf\",\n        local_dir=\"/model\",\n        token=os.environ[\"HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN\"],\n    )\nMODEL_DIR = \"/model\"\n```\n### Image definition\nWe\u2019ll start from a Dockerhub image recommended by `vLLM`, upgrade the older\nversion of `torch` to a new one specifically built for CUDA 11.8. Next, we install `vLLM` from source to get the latest updates.\nFinally, we\u2019ll use run_function to run the function defined above to ensure the weights of the model\nare saved within the container image.\n```python\nimage = (\n    Image.from_registry(\"nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.12-py3\")\n    .pip_install(\n        \"torch==2.0.1\", index_url=\"https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118\"\n    )\n    # Pinned to 08/15/2023\n    .pip_install(\n        \"vllm @ git+https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.git@805de738f618f8b47ab0d450423d23db1e636fa2\",\n        \"typing-extensions==4.5.0\",  # >=4.6 causes typing issues\n    )\n    # Use the barebones hf-transfer package for maximum download speeds.

We specify a [schedule](/docs/guide/cron) in the function decorator, which\nmeans that our function will run automatically at the given interval.\n```python\n@stub.function(image=requests_image)\ndef search_hackernews():\n    import requests\n    url = \"http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search\"\n    threshold = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=WINDOW_SIZE_DAYS)\n    params = {\n        \"query\": QUERY,\n        \"numericFilters\": f\"created_at_i>{threshold.timestamp()}\",\n    }\n    response = requests.get(url, params).json()\n    urls = [item[\"url\"] for item in response[\"hits\"] if item[\"url\"]]\n    print(f\"Query returned {len(urls)} items.\")\n    for _ in post_to_slack.map(urls):\n        pass\n```\n## Test running\nWe can now test run our scheduled function as follows: `modal run hackernews_alerts.py::stub.search_hackernews`\n## Defining the schedule and deploying\nLet's define a function that will be called by Modal every day\n```python\n@stub.function(schedule=modal.Period(days=1))\ndef run_daily():\n    search_hackernews.remote()\n```\nIn order to deploy this as a persistent cron job, you can run `modal deploy hackernews_alerts.py`,\nOnce the job is deployed, visit the [apps page](/apps) page to see\nits execution history, logs and other stats.\n"}

{"text": "\n# Stable Diffusion CLI\nThis example shows Stable Diffusion 1.5 with a number of optimizations\nthat makes it run faster on Modal. The example takes about 10s to cold start\nand about 1.0s per image generated.\nTo use the new XL 1.0 model, see the example posted [here](/docs/guide/ex/stable_diffusion_xl).\nFor instance, here are 9 images produced by the prompt\n`An 1600s oil painting of the New York City skyline`\n![stable diffusion slackbot](./stable_diffusion_montage.png)\nThere is also a [Stable Diffusion Slack bot example](/docs/guide/ex/stable_diffusion_slackbot)\nwhich does not have all the optimizations, but shows how you can set up a Slack command to\ntrigger Stable Diffusion.\n## Optimizations used in this example\nAs mentioned, we use a few optimizations to run this faster:\n* Use [run_function](/docs/reference/modal.Image#run_function) to download the model while building the container image\n* Use a [container lifecycle method](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) to initialize the model on container startup\n* Use A10G GPUs\n* Use 16 bit floating point math\n## Basic setup\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\nimport io\nimport time\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom modal import Image, Stub, method\n```\nAll Modal programs need a [`Stub`](/docs/reference/modal.Stub) \u2014 an object that acts as a recipe for\nthe application. Let's give it a friendly name.\n```python\nstub = Stub(\"stable-diffusion-cli\")\n```\n## Model dependencies\nYour model will be running remotely inside a container. We will be installing\nall the model dependencies in the next step. We will also be \"baking the model\"\ninto the image by running a Python function as a part of building the image.\nThis lets us start containers much faster, since all the data that's needed is\nalready inside the image.\n```python\nmodel_id = \"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\"\ncache_path = \"/vol/cache\"\ndef download_models():\n    import diffusers\n    import torch\n    # Download scheduler configuration.

This\ncan be a huge optimization when you're calling a function multiple times,\nsince Modal reuses the same containers when possible.\nThe way to implement this is to turn the Modal function into a method on a\nclass that also implement the Python context manager interface, meaning it\nhas the `__enter__` method (the `__exit__` method is optional).\nWe have also have applied a few model optimizations to make the model run\nfaster. On an A10G, the model takes about 6.5s to load into memory, and then\n1.6s per generation on average. On a T4, it takes 13s to load and 3.7s per\ngeneration. Other optimizations are also available [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/fp16#memory-and-speed).\nThis is our Modal function. The function runs through the `StableDiffusionPipeline` pipeline.\nIt sends the PIL image back to our CLI where we save the resulting image in a local file.\n```python\n@stub.cls(gpu=\"A10G\")\nclass StableDiffusion:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        import diffusers\n        import torch\n        torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True\n        scheduler = diffusers.DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_pretrained(\n            cache_path,\n            subfolder=\"scheduler\",\n            solver_order=2,\n            prediction_type=\"epsilon\",\n            thresholding=False,\n            algorithm_type=\"dpmsolver++\",\n            solver_type=\"midpoint\",\n            denoise_final=True,  # important if steps are <= 10\n            low_cpu_mem_usage=True,\n            device_map=\"auto\",\n        )\n        self.pipe = diffusers.StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n            cache_path,\n            scheduler=scheduler,\n            low_cpu_mem_usage=True,\n            device_map=\"auto\",\n        )\n        self.pipe.enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention()\n    @method()\n    def run_inference(\n        self, prompt: str, steps: int = 20, batch_size: int = 4\n    ) -> list[bytes]:\n        import torch\n        with torch.inference_mode():\n            with torch.autocast(\"cuda\"):\n                images = self.pipe(\n                    [prompt] * batch_size,\n                    num_inference_steps=steps,\n                    guidance_scale=7.0,\n                ).images\n        # Convert to PNG bytes\n        image_output = []\n        for image in images:\n            with io.BytesIO() as buf:\n                image.save(buf, format=\"PNG\")\n                image_output.append(buf.getvalue())\n        return image_output\n```\nThis is the command we'll use to generate images. It takes a `prompt`,\n`samples` (the number of images you want to generate), `steps` which\nconfigures the number of inference steps the model will make, and `batch_size`\nwhich determines how many images to generate for a given prompt.\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef entrypoint(\n    prompt: str, samples: int = 5, steps: int = 10, batch_size: int = 1\n):\n    print(\n        f\"prompt => {prompt}, steps => {steps}, samples => {samples}, batch_size => {batch_size}\"\n    )\n    dir = Path(\"/tmp/stable-diffusion\")\n    if not dir.exists():\n        dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)\n    sd = StableDiffusion()\n    for i in range(samples):\n        t0 = time.time()\n        images = sd.run_inference.remote(prompt, steps, batch_size)\n        total_time = time.time() - t0\n        print(\n            f\"Sample {i} took {total_time:.3f}s ({(total_time)/len(images):.3f}s / image).\"\n        )\n        for j, image_bytes in enumerate(images):\n            output_path = dir / f\"output_{j}_{i}.png\"\n            print(f\"Saving it to {output_path}\")\n            with open(output_path, \"wb\") as f:\n                f.write(image_bytes)\n```\nAnd this is our entrypoint; where the CLI is invoked.

All calls\nto Modal functions should be made within the scope of this context\nmanager, and they will correspond to the current app.\nSee the documentation for the [`App`](modal.App) class for more details.\n## registered_functions\n```python\n@property\ndef registered_functions(self) -> Dict[str, _Function]:\n```\nAll modal.Function objects registered on the stub.\n## registered_entrypoints\n```python\n@property\ndef registered_entrypoints(self) -> Dict[str, _LocalEntrypoint]:\n```\nAll local CLI entrypoints registered on the stub.\n## registered_web_endpoints\n```python\n@property\ndef registered_web_endpoints(self) -> List[str]:\n```\nNames of web endpoint (ie. webhook) functions registered on the stub.\n## local_entrypoint\n```python\ndef local_entrypoint(self, name: Optional[str] = None) -> Callable[[Callable[..., Any]], None]:\n```\nDecorate a function to be used as a CLI entrypoint for a Modal App.\nThese functions can be used to define code that runs locally to set up the app,\nand act as an entrypoint to start Modal functions from. Note that regular\nModal functions can also be used as CLI entrypoints, but unlike `local_entrypoint`,\nthose functions are executed remotely directly.\n**Example**\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef main():\n    some_modal_function.call()\n```\nYou can call the function using `modal run` directly from the CLI:\n```shell\nmodal run stub_module.py\n```\nNote that an explicit [`stub.run()`](/docs/reference/modal.Stub#run) is not needed, as an\n[app](/docs/guide/apps) is automatically created for you.\n**Multiple Entrypoints**\nIf you have multiple `local_entrypoint` functions, you can qualify the name of your stub and function:\n```shell\nmodal run stub_module.py::stub.some_other_function\n```\n**Parsing Arguments**\nIf your entrypoint function take arguments with primitive types, `modal run` automatically parses them as\nCLI options. For example, the following function can be called with `modal run stub_module.py --foo 1 --bar \"hello\"`:\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef main(foo: int, bar: str):\n    some_modal_function.call(foo, bar)\n```\nCurrently, `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `datetime.datetime` are supported.

{"text": "# modal.config\nModal intentionally keeps configurability to a minimum.\nThe main configuration options are the API tokens: the token id and the token secret.\nThese can be configured in two ways:\n1. By running the ``modal token set`` command.\n   This writes the tokens to ``.modal.toml`` file in your home directory.\n2. By setting the environment variables ``MODAL_TOKEN_ID`` and ``MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET``.\n   This takes precedence over the previous method.\n.modal.toml\n---------------\nThe ``.modal.toml`` file is generally stored in your home directory.\nIt should look like this::\n```toml\n[default]\ntoken_id = \"ak-12345...\"\ntoken_secret = \"as-12345...\"\n```\nYou can create this file manually, or you can run the ``modal token set ...``\ncommand (see below).\nSetting tokens using the CLI\n----------------------------\nYou can set a token by running the command::\n```bash\nmodal token set \\\n  --token-id <token id> \\\n  --token-secret <token secret>\n```\nThis will write the token id and secret to ``.modal.toml``.\nIf the token id or secret is provided as the string ``-`` (a single dash),\nthen it will be read in a secret way from stdin instead.\nOther configuration options\n---------------------------\nOther possible configuration options are:\n* ``loglevel`` (in the .toml file) / ``MODAL_LOGLEVEL`` (as an env var).\n  Defaults to ``WARNING``.\n  Set this to ``DEBUG`` to see a bunch of internal output.\n* ``logs_timeout`` (in the .toml file) / ``MODAL_LOGS_TIMEOUT`` (as an env var).\n  Defaults to 10.\n  Number of seconds to wait for logs to drain when closing the session,\n  before giving up.\n* ``automount`` (in the .toml file) / ``MODAL_AUTOMOUNT`` (as an env var).\n  Defaults to True.\n  By default, Modal automatically mounts modules imported in the current scope, that\n  are deemed to be \"local\". This can be turned off by setting this to False.\n* ``server_url`` (in the .toml file) / ``MODAL_SERVER_URL`` (as an env var).\n  Defaults to ``https://api.modal.com``.\n  Not typically meant to be used.\nMeta-configuration\n------------------\nSome \"meta-options\" are set using environment variables only:\n* ``MODAL_CONFIG_PATH`` lets you override the location of the .toml file,\n  by default ``~/.modal.toml``.\n* ``MODAL_PROFILE`` lets you use multiple sections in the .toml file\n  and switch between them.

{"text": "\n# Finetuning Flan-T5\nExample by [@anishpdalal](https://github.com/anishpdalal)\n[Flan-T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5) is a highly versatile model that's been instruction-tuned to\nperform well on a variety of text-based tasks such as question answering and summarization. There are smaller model variants available which makes\nFlan-T5 a great base model to use for finetuning on a specific instruction dataset with just a single GPU. In this example, we'll\nfinetune Flan-T5 on the [Extreme Sum (\"XSum\")](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xsum) dataset to summarize news articles.\n## Defining dependencies\nThe example uses the `dataset` package from HuggingFace to load the xsum dataset. It also uses the `transformers`\nand `accelerate` packages with a PyTorch backend to finetune and serve the model. Finally, we also\ninstall `tensorboard` and serve it via a web app. All packages are installed into a Debian Slim base image\nusing the `pip_install` function.\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport modal\nfrom modal import Image, Stub, Volume, method, wsgi_app\nVOL_MOUNT_PATH = Path(\"/vol\")\n```\nOther Flan-T5 models can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5)\n```python\nBASE_MODEL = \"google/flan-t5-base\"\nimage = Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\n    \"accelerate\",\n    \"transformers\",\n    \"torch\",\n    \"datasets\",\n    \"tensorboard\",\n)\nstub = Stub(name=\"example-news-summarizer\", image=image)\noutput_vol = Volume.persisted(\"finetune-volume\")\nstub.volume = output_vol\n```\n### Handling preemption\nAs this finetuning job is long-running it's possible that it experiences a preemption.\nThe training code is robust to pre-emption events by periodically saving checkpoints and restoring\nfrom checkpoint on restart. But it's also helpful to observe in logs when a preemption restart has occurred,\nso we track restarts with a `modal.Dict`.\nSee the [guide on preemptions](/docs/guide/preemption#preemption) for more details on preemption handling.\n```python\nstub.restart_tracker_dict = modal.Dict.new()\ndef track_restarts(restart_tracker: modal.Dict):\n    if not restart_tracker.contains(\"count\"):\n        preemption_count = 0\n        print(f\"Starting first time. {preemption_count=}\")\n        restart_tracker[\"count\"] = preemption_count = 0\n    else:\n        preemption_count = restart_tracker.get(\"count\") + 1\n        print(f\"Restarting after pre-emption. {preemption_count=}\")\n        restart_tracker[\"count\"] = preemption_count\n```\n## Finetuning Flan-T5 on XSum dataset\nEach row in the dataset has a `document` (input news article) and `summary` column.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    gpu=\"A10g\",\n    timeout=7200,\n    volumes={VOL_MOUNT_PATH: output_vol},\n)\ndef finetune(num_train_epochs: int = 1, size_percentage: int = 10):\n    from datasets import load_dataset\n    from transformers import (\n        AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM,\n        AutoTokenizer,\n        DataCollatorForSeq2Seq,\n        Seq2SeqTrainer,\n        Seq2SeqTrainingArguments,\n        TrainerCallback,\n    )\n    track_restarts(stub.restart_tracker_dict)\n    # Use size percentage to retrieve subset of the dataset to iterate faster\n    if size_percentage:\n        xsum_train = load_dataset(\"xsum\", split=f\"train[:{size_percentage}%]\")\n        xsum_test = load_dataset(\"xsum\", split=f\"test[:{size_percentage}%]\")\n    # Load the whole dataset\n    else:\n        xsum = load_dataset(\"xsum\")\n        xsum_train = xsum[\"train\"]\n        xsum_test = xsum[\"test\"]\n    # Load the tokenizer and model\n    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(BASE_MODEL)\n    model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(BASE_MODEL)\n    # Replace all padding tokens with a large negative number so that the loss function ignores them in\n    # its calculation\n    padding_token_id = -100\n    batch_size = 8\n    def preprocess(batch):\n        # prepend summarize: prefix to document to convert the example to a summarization instruction\n        inputs = [\"summarize: \" + doc for doc in batch[\"document\"]]\n        model_inputs = tokenizer(\n            inputs, max_length=512, truncation=True, padding=\"max_length\"\n        )\n        labels = tokenizer(\n            text_target=batch[\"summary\"],\n            max_length=128,\n            truncation=True,\n            padding=\"max_length\",\n        )\n        labels[\"input_ids\"] = [\n            [\n                l if l != tokenizer.pad_token_id else padding_token_id\n                for l in label\n            ]\n            for label in labels[\"input_ids\"]\n        ]\n        model_inputs[\"labels\"] = labels[\"input_ids\"]\n        return model_inputs\n    tokenized_xsum_train = xsum_train.map(\n        preprocess, batched=True, remove_columns=[\"document\", \"summary\", \"id\"]\n    )\n    tokenized_xsum_test = xsum_test.map(\n        preprocess, batched=True, remove_columns=[\"document\", \"summary\", \"id\"]\n    )\n    data_collator = DataCollatorForSeq2Seq(\n        tokenizer,\n        model=model,\n        label_pad_token_id=padding_token_id,\n        pad_to_multiple_of=batch_size,\n    )\n    class CheckpointCallback(TrainerCallback):\n        def __init__(self, volume):\n            self.volume = volume\n        def on_save(self, args, state, control, **kwargs):\n            \"\"\"\n            Event called after a checkpoint save.\n            \"\"\"\n            if state.is_world_process_zero:\n                print(\"running commit on modal.Volume after model checkpoint\")\n                self.volume.commit()\n    training_args = Seq2SeqTrainingArguments(\n        # Save checkpoints to the mounted volume\n        output_dir=str(VOL_MOUNT_PATH / \"model\"),\n        per_device_train_batch_size=batch_size,\n        per_device_eval_batch_size=batch_size,\n        predict_with_generate=True,\n        learning_rate=3e-5,\n        num_train_epochs=num_train_epochs,\n        logging_strategy=\"steps\",\n        logging_steps=100,\n        evaluation_strategy=\"steps\",\n        save_strategy=\"steps\",\n        save_steps=750,\n        save_total_limit=2,\n        load_best_model_at_end=True,\n    )\n    trainer = Seq2SeqTrainer(\n        model=model,\n        args=training_args,\n        callbacks=[CheckpointCallback(stub.volume)],\n        data_collator=data_collator,\n        train_dataset=tokenized_xsum_train,\n        eval_dataset=tokenized_xsum_test,\n    )\n    try:\n        trainer.train(resume_from_checkpoint=True)\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:  # handle possible preemption\n        print(\"received interrupt;

However, this same application structure\ncould be extended to do question-answering over all State of the Union speeches, or other large text corpuses.\nIt's the [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) library that makes this all so easy.

He also nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to continue in Justice Breyer's legacy.\n```\nTo see the text of the sources the model chain used to provide the answer, set the `--show-sources` flag.\n```bash\nmodal run potus_speech_qanda.py \\\n   --query \"How many oil barrels were released from reserves\" \\\n   --show-sources=True\n```\n## Test run the web endpoint\nModal makes it trivially easy to ship LangChain chains to the web. We can test drive this app's web endpoint\nby running `modal serve potus_speech_qanda.py` and then hitting the endpoint with `curl`:\n```bash\ncurl --get \\\n  --data-urlencode \"query=What did the president say about Justice Breyer\" \\\n  https://modal-labs--example-langchain-qanda-web.modal.run\n```\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"The president thanked Justice Breyer for his service and mentioned his legacy of excellence.

{"text": "\n# Document OCR web app\nThis tutorial shows you how to use Modal to deploy a fully serverless\n[React](https://reactjs.org/) + [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) application.\nWe're going to build a simple \"Receipt Parser\" web app that submits OCR transcription\ntasks to a separate Modal app defined in the [Job Queue\ntutorial](/docs/guide/ex/doc_ocr_jobs), polls until the task is completed, and displays\nthe results. Try it out for yourself\n[here](https://modal-labs-example-doc-ocr-webapp-wrapper.modal.run/).\n![receipt parser frontend](./receipt_parser_frontend.jpg)\n## Basic setup\nLet's get the imports out of the way and define a [`Stub`](/docs/reference/modal.Stub).\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport fastapi\nimport fastapi.staticfiles\nfrom modal import Function, Mount, Stub, asgi_app\nstub = Stub(\"example-doc-ocr-webapp\")\n```\nModal works with any [ASGI](/docs/guide/webhooks#serving-asgi-and-wsgi-apps) or\n[WSGI](/docs/guide/webhooks#wsgi) web framework. Here, we choose to use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).\n```python\nweb_app = fastapi.FastAPI()\n```\n## Define endpoints\nWe need two endpoints: one to accept an image and submit it to the Modal job queue,\nand another to poll for the results of the job.\nIn `parse`, we're going to submit tasks to the function defined in the [Job\nQueue tutorial](/docs/guide/ex/doc_ocr_jobs), so we import it first using\n[`Function.lookup`](/docs/reference/modal.Function#lookup).\nWe call [`.spawn()`](/docs/reference/modal.Function#spawn) on the function handle\nwe imported above, to kick off our function without blocking on the results. `spawn` returns\na unique ID for the function call, that we can use later to poll for its result.\n```python\n@web_app.post(\"/parse\")\nasync def parse(request: fastapi.Request):\n    parse_receipt = Function.lookup(\"example-doc-ocr-jobs\", \"parse_receipt\")\n    form = await request.form()\n    receipt = await form[\"receipt\"].read()  # type: ignore\n    call = parse_receipt.spawn(receipt)\n    return {\"call_id\": call.object_id}\n```\n`/result` uses the provided `call_id` to instantiate a `modal.FunctionCall` object, and attempt\nto get its result. If the call hasn't finished yet, we return a `202` status code, which indicates\nthat the server is still working on the job.\n```python\n@web_app.get(\"/result/{call_id}\")\nasync def poll_results(call_id: str):\n    from modal.functions import FunctionCall\n    function_call = FunctionCall.from_id(call_id)\n    try:\n        result = function_call.get(timeout=0)\n    except TimeoutError:\n        return fastapi.responses.JSONResponse(content=\"\", status_code=202)\n    return result\n```\nFinally, we mount the static files for our front-end. We've made [a simple React\napp](https://github.com/modal-labs/modal-examples/tree/main/09_job_queues/doc_ocr_frontend)\nthat hits the two endpoints defined above. To package these files with our app, first\nwe get the local assets path, and then create a modal [`Mount`](/docs/guide/local-data#mounting-directories)\nthat mounts this directory at `/assets` inside our container. Then, we instruct FastAPI to [serve\nthis static file directory](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/static-files/) at our root path.\n```python\nassets_path = Path(__file__).parent / \"doc_ocr_frontend\"\n@stub.function(\n    mounts=[Mount.from_local_dir(assets_path, remote_path=\"/assets\")]\n)\n@asgi_app()\ndef wrapper():\n    web_app.mount(\n        \"/\", fastapi.staticfiles.StaticFiles(directory=\"/assets\", html=True)\n    )\n    return web_app\n```\n## Running\nYou can run this as an ephemeral app, by running the command\n```shell\nmodal serve doc_ocr_webapp.py\n```\n## Deploy\nThat's all! To deploy your application, run\n```shell\nmodal deploy doc_ocr_webapp.py\n```\nIf successful, this will print a URL for your app, that you can navigate to from\nyour browser \ud83c\udf89 .\n![receipt parser processed](./receipt_parser_frontend_2.jpg)\n## Developing\nIf desired, instead of deploying, we can [serve](/docs/guide/webhooks#developing-with-modal-serve)\nour app ephemerally. In this case, Modal watches all the mounted files, and updates\nthe app if anything changes.\n"}
{"text": "\n# Algolia docsearch crawler\nThis tutorial shows you how to use Modal to run the [Algolia docsearch\ncrawler](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/legacy/run-your-own/) to index your\nwebsite and make it searchable. This is not just example code - we run the same\ncode in production to power search on this page (`Ctrl+K` to try it out!).\n## Basic setup\nLet's get the imports out of the way.\n```python\nimport json\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nfrom modal import Image, Secret, Stub, web_endpoint\n```\nModal lets you [use and extend existing Docker images](/docs/guide/custom-container#using-existing-docker-hub-images),\nas long as they have `python` and `pip` available. We'll use the official crawler image built by Algolia, with a small\nadjustment: since this image has `python` symlinked to `python3.6` and Modal is not compatible with Python 3.6, we\ninstall Python 3.8 and symlink that as the `python` executable instead.\n```python\nalgolia_image = Image.from_registry(\n    tag=\"algolia/docsearch-scraper\",\n    setup_dockerfile_commands=[\n        \"RUN apt-get update\",\n        \"RUN apt-get install -y python3.8 python3-distutils wget\",\n        \"RUN wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\",\n        \"RUN python3.8 get-pip.py\",\n        \"RUN ln --symbolic --force --no-dereference /usr/bin/python3.8 /usr/bin/python\",\n        \"ENTRYPOINT []\",\n    ],\n)\nstub = Stub(\"example-algolia-indexer\")\n```\n## Configure the crawler\nNow, let's configure the crawler with the website we want to index, and which\nCSS selectors we want to scrape. Complete documentation for crawler configuration is available\n[here](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/legacy/config-file).\n```python\nCONFIG = {\n    \"index_name\": \"modal_docs\",\n    \"start_urls\": [\n        {\"url\": \"https://modal.com/docs/guide\", \"page_rank\": 5},\n        {\"url\": \"https://modal.com/docs/reference\", \"page_rank\": 1},\n    ],\n    \"selectors\": {\n        \"lvl0\": \"article h1\",\n        \"lvl1\": \"article h1\",\n        \"lvl2\": \"article h2\",\n        \"lvl3\": \"article h3\",\n        \"lvl4\": \"article h4\",\n        \"text\": \"article p,article ol,article ul,article pre\",\n    },\n}\n```\n## Create an API key\nIf you don't already have one, sign up for an account on [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/). Set up\na project and create an API key with `write` access to your index, and with the ACL permissions\n`addObject`, `editSettings` and `deleteIndex`. Now, create a secret on the Modal [Secrets](/secrets)\npage with the `API_KEY` and `APPLICATION_ID` you just created. You can name this anything you want,\nwe named it `algolia-secret`.\n## The actual function\nWe want to trigger our crawler from our CI/CD pipeline, so we're serving it as a\n[web endpoint](/docs/guide/webhooks#web_endpoint) that can be triggered by a `GET` request during deploy.\nYou could also consider running the crawler on a [schedule](/docs/guide/cron).\nThe Algolia crawler is written for Python 3.6 and needs to run in the `pipenv` created for it,\nso we're invoking it using a subprocess.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    image=algolia_image, secrets=[Secret.from_name(\"algolia-secret\")]\n)\ndef crawl():\n    # Installed with a 3.6 venv; Python 3.6 is unsupported by Modal, so use a subprocess instead.\n    subprocess.run(\n        [\"pipenv\", \"run\", \"python\", \"-m\", \"src.index\"],\n        env={**os.environ, \"CONFIG\": json.dumps(CONFIG)},\n    )\n```\nWe want to be able to trigger this function through a webhook.\n```python\n@stub.function()\n@web_endpoint()\ndef crawl_webhook():\n    crawl.remote()\n    return \"Finished indexing docs\"\n```\n## Deploy the indexer\nThat's all the code we need! To deploy your application, run\n```shell\nmodal deploy algolia_indexer.py\n```\nIf successful, this will print a URL for your new webhook, that you can hit using\n`curl` or a browser. Logs from webhook invocations can be found from the [apps](/apps)\npage.\nThe indexed contents can be found at https://www.algolia.com/apps/APP_ID/explorer/browse/, for your\nAPP_ID. Once you're happy with the results, you can [set up the `docsearch` package with your\nwebsite](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/docsearch-v3/), and create a search component that uses this index.\n## Entrypoint for development\nTo make it easier to test this, we also have an entrypoint for when you run\n`modal run algolia_indexer.py`\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef run():\n    crawl.remote()\n```\n"}

This lets us load the model only once per\n  container, so that it's reused for subsequent function calls.\n* Above we stored the model in the container image. This lets us download the model only\n  when the image is (re)built, and not everytime the function is called.\n* We're running it on multiple CPUs for extra performance\nNote that the function takes an image and returns a new image.\nThe input image is from the webcam\nThe output image is an image with all the bounding boxes and labels on them,\nwith an alpha channel so that most of the image is transparent so that the\nweb interface can render it on top of the webcam view.\n```python\n@stub.cls(\n    cpu=4,\n    image=image,\n)\nclass ObjectDetection:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        from transformers import DetrForObjectDetection, DetrImageProcessor\n        self.feature_extractor = DetrImageProcessor.from_pretrained(\n            model_repo_id,\n            cache_dir=\"/cache\",\n        )\n        self.model = DetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained(\n            model_repo_id,\n            cache_dir=\"/cache\",\n        )\n    @method()\n    def detect(self, img_data_in):\n        # Based on https://huggingface.co/spaces/nateraw/detr-object-detection/blob/main/app.py\n        from PIL import Image, ImageColor, ImageDraw, ImageFont\n        # Read png from input\n        image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(img_data_in)).convert(\"RGB\")\n        # Make prediction\n        import torch\n        inputs = self.feature_extractor(image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n        outputs = self.model(**inputs)\n        img_size = torch.tensor([tuple(reversed(image.size))])\n        processed_outputs = (\n            self.feature_extractor.post_process_object_detection(\n                outputs=outputs,\n                target_sizes=img_size,\n                threshold=0,\n            )\n        )\n        output_dict = processed_outputs[0]\n        # Grab boxes\n        keep = output_dict[\"scores\"] > 0.7\n        boxes = output_dict[\"boxes\"][keep].tolist()\n        scores = output_dict[\"scores\"][keep].tolist()\n        labels = output_dict[\"labels\"][keep].tolist()\n        # Plot bounding boxes\n        colors = list(ImageColor.colormap.values())\n        font = ImageFont.truetype(\n            \"/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeMono.ttf\", 18\n        )\n        output_image = Image.new(\"RGBA\", (image.width, image.height))\n        output_image_draw = ImageDraw.Draw(output_image)\n        for _score, box, label in zip(scores, boxes, labels):\n            color = colors[label % len(colors)]\n            text = self.model.config.id2label[label]\n            box = tuple(map(int, box))\n            output_image_draw.rectangle(box, outline=color)\n            output_image_draw.text(\n                box[:2], text, font=font, fill=color, width=3\n            )\n        # Return PNG as bytes\n        with io.BytesIO() as output_buf:\n            output_image.save(output_buf, format=\"PNG\")\n            return output_buf.getvalue()\n```\n## Defining the web interface\nTo keep things clean, we define the web endpoints separate from the prediction\nfunction. This will introduce a tiny bit of extra latency (every web request\ntriggers a Modal function call which will call another Modal function) but in\npractice the overhead is much smaller than the overhead of running the prediction\nfunction etc.\nWe also serve a static html page which contains some tiny bit of Javascript to\ncapture the webcam feed and send it to Modal.\n```python\nweb_app = FastAPI()\nstatic_path = Path(__file__).with_name(\"webcam\").resolve()\n```\nThe endpoint for the prediction function takes an image as a\n[data URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme)\nand returns another image, also as a data URI:\n```python\n@web_app.post(\"/predict\")\nasync def predict(request: Request):\n    # Takes a webcam image as a datauri, returns a bounding box image as a datauri\n    body = await request.body()\n    img_data_in = base64.b64decode(body.split(b\",\")[1])  # read data-uri\n    img_data_out = ObjectDetection().detect.remote(img_data_in)\n    output_data = b\"data:image/png;base64,\" + base64.b64encode(img_data_out)\n    return Response(content=output_data)\n```\n## Exposing the web server\nLet's take the Fast API app and expose it to Modal.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    mounts=[Mount.from_local_dir(static_path, remote_path=\"/assets\")],\n)\n@asgi_app()\ndef fastapi_app():\n    web_app.mount(\"/\", StaticFiles(directory=\"/assets\", html=True))\n    return web_app\n```\n## Running this locally\nYou can run this as an ephemeral app, by running\n```shell\nmodal serve webcam.py\n```\n"}
{"text": "\n# FastAI model training with Weights & Biases and Gradio\nThis example trains a vision model to 98-99% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset,\nand then makes this trained model shareable with others using the [Gradio.app](https://gradio.app/)\nweb interface framework.\nCombining GPU-accelerated Modal Functions, a network file system for caching, and Modal\nwebhooks for the model demo, we have a simple, productive, and cost-effective\npathway to building and deploying ML in the cloud!\n![Gradio.app image classifer interface](./gradio-image-classify.png)\n## Setting up the dependencies\nOur GPU training is done with PyTorch which bundles its CUDA dependencies, so\nwe can start with a slim Debian OS image and install a handful of `pip` packages into it.\n```python\nimport dataclasses\nimport os\nimport pathlib\nimport sys\nfrom typing import List, Optional, Tuple\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom modal import (\n    Image,\n    Mount,\n    NetworkFileSystem,\n    Secret,\n    Stub,\n    asgi_app,\n    method,\n)\nweb_app = FastAPI()\nassets_path = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / \"vision_model_training\" / \"assets\"\nstub = Stub(name=\"example-fastai-wandb-gradio-cifar10-demo\")\nimage = Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\n    \"fastai~=2.7.9\",\n    \"gradio~=3.6\",\n    \"httpx~=0.23.0\",\n    # When using pip PyTorch is not automatically installed by fastai.\n    \"torch~=1.12.1\",\n    \"torchvision~=0.13.1\",\n    \"wandb~=0.13.4\",\n)\n```\nA persisted network file system will store trained model artefacts across Modal app runs.\nThis is crucial as training runs are separate from the Gradio.app we run as a webhook.\n```python\nvolume = NetworkFileSystem.persisted(\"cifar10-training-vol\")\nFASTAI_HOME = \"/fastai_home\"\nMODEL_CACHE = pathlib.Path(FASTAI_HOME, \"models\")\nUSE_GPU = os.environ.get(\"MODAL_GPU\")\nMODEL_EXPORT_PATH = pathlib.Path(MODEL_CACHE, \"model-exports\", \"inference.pkl\")\nos.environ[\n    \"FASTAI_HOME\"\n] = FASTAI_HOME  # Ensure fastai saves data into persistent volume path.\n```\n## Config\nTraining config gets its own dataclass to avoid smattering special/magic values throughout code.\n```python\n@dataclasses.dataclass\nclass WandBConfig:\n    project: str = \"fast-cifar10\"\n    entity: Optional[str] = None\n@dataclasses.dataclass\nclass Config:\n    epochs: int = 10\n    img_dims: Tuple[int, int] = (32, 224)\n    gpu: str = USE_GPU\n    wandb: WandBConfig = WandBConfig()\n```\n## Get CIFAR-10 dataset\nThe `fastai` framework famously requires very little code to get things done,\nso our downloading function is very short and simple. The CIFAR-10 dataset is\nalso not large, about 150MB, so we don't bother persisting it in a network file system\nand just download and unpack it to ephemeral disk.\n```python\ndef download_dataset():\n    from fastai.data.external import URLs, untar_data\n    path = untar_data(URLs.CIFAR)\n    print(f\"Finished downloading and unpacking CIFAR-10 dataset to {path}.\")\n    return path\n```\n## Training a vision model with FastAI\nTo address the CIFAR-10 image classification problem, we use the high-level fastAI framework\nto train a Deep Residual Network (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) with 18-layers, called `resnet18`.\nWe don't train the model from scratch. A transfer learning approach is sufficient to reach 98-99%\naccuracy on the classification task. The main tweak we make is to adjust the image size of the CIFAR-10\nexamples to be 224x224, which was the image size the `resnet18` model was originally trained on.\nJust to demonstrate the affect of the image upscaling on classification performance, we still train on\nthe original size 32x32 images.\n### Tracking with Weights & Biases\n![weights & biases UI](./wandb-ui.png)\nWeights & Biases (W&B) is a product that provides out-of-the-box model training observability. With a few\nlines of code and an account, we gain a dashboard will key metrics such as training loss, accuracy, and GPU\nutilization.\nIf you want to run this example without setting up Weights & Biases, just remove the\n`secret=Secret.from_name(\"wandb\")` line from the Function decorator below; this will disable Weights & Biases\nfunctionality.\n### Detaching our training run\nFine-tuning the base ResNet model takes about 30-40 minutes on a GPU.

{"text": "# Write to Google Sheets\nIn this tutorial, we'll show how to use Modal to schedule a daily update of a dataset\nfrom an analytics database to Google Sheets.\n## Entering credentials\nWe begin by setting up some credentials that we'll need in order to access our database and output\nspreadsheet. To do that in a secure manner, we log in to our Modal account on the web and go to\nthe [Secrets](/secrets) section.\n### Database\nFirst we will enter our database credentials. The easiest way to do this is to click **New\nsecret** and select the **Postgres compatible** secret preset and fill in the requested\ninformation. Then we press **Next** and name our secret \"analytics-database\" and click **Create**.\n### Google Sheets/GCP\nWe'll now add another Secret for Google Sheets access through Google Cloud Platform. Click **New\nsecret** and select the Google Sheets preset.\nIn order to access the Google Sheets API, we'll need to create a *Service Account* in Google Cloud\nPlatform. You can skip this step if you already have a Service Account json file.\n1. Sign up to Google Cloud Platform or log in if you haven't\n   ([https://cloud.google.com/](https://cloud.google.com/)).\n2. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n3. In the navigation pane on the left, go to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**.\n4. Click the **+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT** button.\n5. Give the service account a suitable name, like \"sheet-access-bot\". Click **Done**. You don't\n   have to grant it any specific access privileges at this time.\n6. Click your new service account in the list view that appears and navigate to the **Keys**\n   section.\n7. Click **Add key** and choose **Create new key**. Use the **JSON** key type and confirm by\n   clicking **Create**.\n8. A json key file should be downloaded to your computer at this point. Copy the contents of that\n   file and use it as the value for the **SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON** field in your new secret.\nWe'll name this other secret \"gsheets\".\nNow you can access the values of your secrets from modal functions that you annotate with the\ncorresponding EnvDict includes, e.g.:\n```python\nimport os\nimport modal\nstub = modal.Stub(\"example-db-to-sheet\")\n@stub.function(secret=modal.Secret.from_name(\"postgres-secret\"))\ndef my_func():\n    # automatically filled from the specified secret\n    print(\"Host is \" + os.environ[\"PGHOST\"])\n```\nIn order to connect to the database, we'll use the `psycopg2` Python package. To make it available\nto your Modal function you need to supply it with an `image` argument that tells Modal how to\nbuild the container image that contains that package. We'll base it off of the `Image.debian_slim` base\nimage that's built into modal, and make sure to install the required binary packages as well as\nthe psycopg2 package itself:\n```python\npg_image = (\n    modal.Image.debian_slim().apt_install(\"libpq-dev\").pip_install(\"psycopg2\")\n)\n```\nSince the default keynames for a **Postgres compatible** secret correspond to the environment\nvariables that `psycopg2` looks for, you can now easily connect to the database even without\nexplicit credentials in your code. We'll create a simple function that queries the city for each\nuser in our dummy `users` table:\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    image=pg_image,\n    secret=modal.Secret.from_name(\"postgres-secret\"),\n)\ndef get_db_rows():\n    import psycopg2\n    conn = psycopg2.connect()  # no explicit credentials needed\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n    cur.execute(\"SELECT city FROM users\")\n    return [row[0] for row in cur.fetchall()]\n```\nNote that we import psycopg2 inside our function instead of the global scope. This allows us to\nrun this Modal function even from an environment where psycopg2 is not installed. We can test run\nthis function using the `modal run` shell command: `modal run db_to_sheet.py::stub.get_db_rows`.\n## Applying Python logic\nFor each city in our source data we'll make an online lookup of the current weather using the\n[http://openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org) API. To do this, we'll add the API key to\nanother modal secret. We'll use a custom secret called \"weather\" with the key\n`OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` containing our API key for OpenWeatherMap.\n```python\nrequests_image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\"requests\")\n@stub.function(\n    image=requests_image,\n    secret=modal.Secret.from_name(\"weather-secret\"),\n)\ndef city_weather(city):\n    import requests\n    url = \"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather\"\n    params = {\"q\": city, \"appid\": os.environ[\"OPENWEATHER_API_KEY\"]}\n    response = requests.get(url, params=params)\n    weather_label = response.json()[\"weather\"][0][\"main\"]\n    return weather_label\n```\nWe'll make use of Modal's built-in `function.map` method to create our report. `function.map`\nmakes it really easy to parallelise work by executing a function for a larger sequence of input\ndata. For this example we'll make a simple count of rows per weather type, using Python's\nstandard library `collections.Counter`.\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n@stub.function()\ndef create_report(cities):\n    # run city_weather for each city in parallel\n    user_weather = city_weather.map(cities)\n    users_by_weather = Counter(user_weather).items()\n    return users_by_weather\n```\nLet's try to run this! To make it simple to trigger the function with some\npredefined input data, we create a \"local entrypoint\" `main` that can be\neasily triggered from the command line:\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef main():\n    cities = [\n        \"Stockholm,,Sweden\",\n        \"New York,NY,USA\",\n        \"Tokyo,,Japan\",\n    ]\n    print(create_report.remote(cities))\n```\nRunning the local entrypoint using `modal run db_to_sheet.py` should print something like:\n`dict_items([('Clouds', 3)])`.\nNote that since this file only has a single stub, and the stub has only one local entrypoint\nwe only have to specify the file to run - the function/entrypoint is inferred.\nIn this case the logic is quite simple, but in a real world context you could have applied a\nmachine learning model or any other tool you could build into a container to transform the data.\n## Sending output to a Google Sheet\nWe'll set up a new Google Sheet to send our report to. Using the \"Sharing\" dialog in Google\nSheets, we make sure to share the document to the service account's email address (the value of\nthe `client_email` field in the json file) and make the service account an editor of the document.\nThe URL of a Google Sheet is something like:\n`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wOktal......IJR77jD8Do`.\nWe copy the part of the URL that comes after `/d/` - that is the *key* of the document which\nwe'll refer to in our code. We'll make use of the `pygsheets` python package to authenticate with\nGoogle Sheets and then update the spreadsheet with information from the report we just created:\n```python\npygsheets_image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\"pygsheets\")\n@stub.function(\n    image=pygsheets_image,\n    secret=modal.Secret.from_name(\"gsheets-secret\"),\n)\ndef update_sheet_report(rows):\n    import pygsheets\n    gc = pygsheets.authorize(service_account_env_var=\"SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON\")\n    document_key = \"1RqQrJ6Ikf611adKunm8tmL1mKzHLjNwLWm_T7mfXSYA\"\n    sh = gc.open_by_key(document_key)\n    worksheet = sh.sheet1\n    worksheet.clear(\"A2\")\n    worksheet.update_values(\"A2\", [list(row) for row in rows])\n```\nAt this point, we have everything we need in order to run the full program. We can put it all together in\nanother Modal function, and add a [schedule](/docs/guide/cron) argument so it runs every day automatically:\n```python\n@stub.function(schedule=modal.Cron(\"0 0 * * *\"))\ndef db_to_sheet():\n    rows = get_db_rows.remote()\n    report = create_report.remote(rows)\n    update_sheet_report.remote(report)\n    print(\"Updated sheet with new weather distribution\")\n    for weather, count in report:\n        print(f\"{weather}: {count}\")\n```\nThis entire stub can now be deployed using `modal deploy db_to_sheet.py`. The [apps page](/apps)\nshows our cron job's execution history and lets you navigate to each invocation's logs.\nTo trigger a manual run from your local code during development, you can also trigger this function using the cli:\n`modal run db_to_sheet.py::stub.db_to_sheet`\nNote that all of the @stub.function() annotated functions above run remotely in isolated containers that are specified per\nfunction, but they are called as seamlessly as using regular Python functions. This is a simple\nshowcase of how you can mix and match functions that use different environments and have them feed\ninto each other or even call each other as if they were all functions in the same local program.\n"}

{"text": "\n# Stable diffusion slackbot\nThis tutorial shows you how to build a Slackbot that uses\n[stable diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release)\nto produce realistic images from text prompts on demand.\n![stable diffusion slackbot](./stable_diff_screenshot.jpg)\n## Basic setup\n```python\nimport io\nimport os\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom modal import Image, Secret, Stub, web_endpoint\n```\nAll Modal programs need a [`Stub`](/docs/reference/modal.Stub) \u2014 an object that acts as a recipe for\nthe application. Let's give it a friendly name.\n```python\nstub = Stub(\"example-stable-diff-bot\")\n```\n## Inference Function\n### HuggingFace token\nWe're going to use the pre-trained stable diffusion model in\nHuggingFace's `diffusers` library. To gain access, you need to sign in to your\nHuggingFace account ([sign up here](https://huggingface.co/join)) and request\naccess on the [model card page](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5).\nNext, [create a HuggingFace access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).\nTo access the token in a Modal function, we can create a secret on the\n[secrets page](https://modal.com/secrets). Let's use the environment variable\nnamed `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`. Functions that inject this secret will have access\nto the environment variable.\n![create a huggingface token](./huggingface_token.png)\n### Model caching\nThe `diffusers` library downloads the weights for a pre-trained model to a local\ndirectory, if those weights don't already exist. To decrease start-up time, we want\nthis download to happen just once, even across separate function invocations.\nTo accomplish this, we use simple function that will run at image build time and save the model into\nthe image's filesystem.\n```python\nCACHE_PATH = \"/root/model_cache\"\ndef fetch_model(local_files_only: bool = False):\n    from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline\n    from torch import float16\n    return StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n        \"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\",\n        use_auth_token=os.environ[\"HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN\"],\n        variant=\"fp16\",\n        torch_dtype=float16,\n        device_map=\"auto\",\n        cache_dir=CACHE_PATH,  # reads model saved in the modal.Image's filesystem.\n        local_files_only=local_files_only,\n    )\nimage = (\n    Image.debian_slim()\n    .run_commands(\n        \"pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117\"\n    )\n    .pip_install(\n        \"diffusers\",\n        \"huggingface-hub\",\n        \"safetensors\",\n        \"transformers\",\n        \"scipy\",\n        \"ftfy\",\n        \"accelerate\",\n    )\n    .run_function(fetch_model, secret=Secret.from_name(\"huggingface-secret\"))\n)\n```\n### The actual function\nNow that we have our token and `modal.Image` set up, we can put everything together.\nLet's define a function that takes a text prompt and an optional channel name\n(so we can post results to Slack if the value is set) and runs stable diffusion.\nThe `@stub.function()` decorator declares all the resources this function will\nuse: we configure it to use a GPU, run on an image that has all the packages and files we\nneed to run the model, and\nalso provide it the secret that contains the token we created above.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    gpu=\"A10G\",\n    image=image,\n    secret=Secret.from_name(\"huggingface-secret\"),\n)\nasync def run_stable_diffusion(prompt: str, channel_name: Optional[str] = None):\n    pipe = fetch_model(local_files_only=True)\n    image = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=100).images[0]\n    # Convert PIL Image to PNG byte array.\n    with io.BytesIO() as buf:\n        image.save(buf, format=\"PNG\")\n        img_bytes = buf.getvalue()\n    if channel_name:\n        # `post_image_to_slack` is implemented further below.\n        post_image_to_slack.remote(prompt, channel_name, img_bytes)\n    return img_bytes\n```\n## Slack webhook\nNow that we wrote our function, we'd like to trigger it from Slack. We can do\nthis with [slash commands](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands)\n\u2014 a feature that lets you register prefixes (such as `/run-my-bot`) to\ntrigger webhooks of your choice.\nTo serve our model as a web endpoint, we apply the\n[`@stub.web_endpoint`](/docs/guide/webhooks#web_endpoint) decorator in addition to\n`@stub.function()`. Modal webhooks are [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)\nendpoints by default (though we accept any ASGI web framework). This webhook\nretrieves the form body passed from Slack.\nInstead of blocking on the result of the stable diffusion model (which could\ntake some time), we want to notify the user immediately that their request\nis being processed. Modal Functions let you\n[`spawn`](/docs/reference/modal.Function#spawn) an input without waiting for\nthe results, which we use here to kick off model inference as a background task.\n```python\nfrom fastapi import Request\n@stub.function()\n@web_endpoint(method=\"POST\")\nasync def entrypoint(request: Request):\n    body = await request.form()\n    prompt = body[\"text\"]\n    run_stable_diffusion.spawn(prompt, body[\"channel_name\"])\n    return f\"Running stable diffusion for {prompt}.\"\n```\n## Post to Slack\nFinally, let's define a function to post images to a Slack channel.\nFirst, we need to create a Slack app and store the token for our app as a\nModal secret. To do so, visit the the Modal [Secrets](/secrets) page and click\n\"create a Slack secret\". Then, you will find instructions on how to create a\nSlack app, give it OAuth permissions, and get a token. Note that you need to\nadd the `file:write` OAuth scope to the created app.\n![create a slack secret](./slack_secret.png)\nBelow, we use the secret and `slack-sdk` to post to a Slack channel.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    image=Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\"slack-sdk\"),\n    secret=Secret.from_name(\"stable-diff-slackbot-secret\"),\n)\ndef post_image_to_slack(title: str, channel_name: str, image_bytes: bytes):\n    import slack_sdk\n    client = slack_sdk.WebClient(token=os.environ[\"SLACK_BOT_TOKEN\"])\n    client.files_upload(channels=channel_name, title=title, content=image_bytes)\n```\n## Deploy the Slackbot\nThat's all the code we need! To deploy your application, run\n```shell\nmodal deploy stable_diffusion_slackbot.py\n```\nIf successful, this will print a URL for your new webhook. To point your Slack\napp at it:\n- Go back to the [Slack apps page](https://api.slack.com/apps/).\n- Find your app and navigate to \"Slash Commands\" under \"Features\" in the left\n  sidebar.\n- Click on \"Create New Command\" and paste the webhook URL from Modal into the\n  \"Request URL\" field.\n- Name the command whatever you like, and hit \"Save\".\n- Reinstall the app to your workspace.\nWe're done! \ud83c\udf89 Install the app to any channel you're in, and you can trigger it\nwith the command you chose above.\n## Run Manually\nWe can also trigger `run_stable_diffusion` manually for easier debugging.\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef run(\n    prompt: str = \"oil painting of a shiba\",\n    output_dir: str = \"/tmp/stable-diffusion\",\n):\n    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    img_bytes = run_stable_diffusion.remote(prompt)\n    output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, \"output.png\")\n    with open(output_path, \"wb\") as f:\n        f.write(img_bytes)\n    print(f\"Wrote data to {output_path}\")\n```\nThis code lets us call our script as follows:\n```shell\nmodal run stable_diffusion_slackbot.py --prompt \"a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars\"\n```\nThe resulting image can be found in `/tmp/stable-diffusion/output.png`.\n"}

but Modal's programmatic\ncontainer image building Python APIs handle this complexity straightforwardly and automatically.\nTo run any of the 10 demo apps, we need the following:\n1. a base Python 3 Linux image (we use Debian Slim)\n2. a bunch of third party PyPi packages\n3. `git`, so that we can download the ControlNet source code (there's no `controlnet` PyPi package)\n4. some image process Linux system packages, including `ffmpeg`\n5. and demo specific pre-trained model and detector `.pth` files\nThat's a lot! Fortunately, the code below is already written for you that stitches together a working container image\nready to produce remarkable ControlNet images.\n**Note:** a ControlNet model pipeline is [now available in Huggingface's `diffusers` package](https://huggingface.co/blog/controlnet).

We want the block interface object,\nbut the queueing and launched webserver aren't compatible with Modal's serverless web endpoint interface,\nso in the `import_gradio_app_blocks` function we patch out these behaviors.\n```python\ndef import_gradio_app_blocks(demo: DemoApp):\n    from gradio import blocks\n    # The ControlNet repo demo scripts are written to be run as\n    # standalone scripts, and have a lot of code that executes\n    # in global scope on import, including the launch of a Gradio web server.\n    # We want Modal to control the Gradio web app serving, so we\n    # monkeypatch the .launch() function to be a no-op.\n    blocks.Blocks.launch = lambda self, server_name: print(\n        \"launch() has been monkeypatched to do nothing.\"\n    )\n    # each demo app module is a file like gradio_{name}.py\n    module_name = f\"gradio_{demo.name}\"\n    mod = importlib.import_module(module_name)\n    blocks = mod.block\n    # disable queueing mode, which is incompatible with our Modal web app setup.\n    blocks.enable_queue = False\n    return blocks\n```\nBecause the ControlNet gradio app's are so time and compute intensive to cold-start\nthe web app function is limited to running just 1 warm container. This way, while playing\nwith the demos we can pay the cold-start cost once and have all web requests hit the warm\ncontainer.

{"text": "\n# Serve a dynamic SVG badge\nIn this example, we use Modal's [webhook](/docs/guide/webhooks) capability to host a dynamic SVG badge that shows\nyou the current # of downloads for a Python package.\nFirst let's start off by creating a Modal stub, and defining an image with the Python packages we're going to be using:\n```python\nfrom modal import Image, Stub, web_endpoint\nstub = Stub(\n    \"example-web-badges\",\n    image=Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\"pybadges\", \"pypistats\"),\n)\n```\n## Defining the web endpoint\nIn addition to using `@stub.function()` to decorate our function, we use the\n`@modal.web_endpoint` decorator ([learn more](/docs/guide/webhooks#web_endpoint)), which instructs Modal\nto create a REST endpoint that serves this function. Note that the default method is `GET`, but this\ncan be overridden using the `method` argument.\n```python\n@stub.function()\n@web_endpoint()\nasync def package_downloads(package_name: str):\n    import json\n    import pypistats\n    from fastapi import Response\n    from pybadges import badge\n    stats = json.loads(pypistats.recent(package_name, format=\"json\"))\n    svg = badge(\n        left_text=f\"{package_name} downloads\",\n        right_text=str(stats[\"data\"][\"last_month\"]),\n        right_color=\"blue\",\n    )\n    return Response(content=svg, media_type=\"image/svg+xml\")\n```\nIn this function, we use `pypistats` to query the most recent stats for our package, and then\nuse that as the text for a SVG badge, rendered using `pybadges`.\nSince Modal web endpoints are FastAPI functions under the hood, we return this SVG wrapped in a FastAPI response with the correct media type.\nAlso note that FastAPI automatically interprets `package_name` as a [query param](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params/).\n## Running and deploying\nWe can now run an ephemeral app on the command line using:\n```shell\nmodal serve badges.py\n```\nThis will create a short-lived web url that exists until you terminate the script.\nIt will also hot-reload the code if you make changes to it.\nIf you want to create a persistent URL, you have to deploy the script.\nTo deploy using the Modal CLI by running `modal deploy badges.py`,\nEither way, as soon as we run this command, Modal gives us the link to our brand new\nweb endpoint in the output:\n![web badge deployment](./badges_deploy.png)\nWe can now visit the link using a web browser, using a `package_name` of our choice in the URL query params.\nFor example:\n- `https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.modal.run/?package_name=synchronicity`\n- `https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.modal.run/?package_name=torch`\n"}

It will take the code, put it inside a\ncontainer, run it, and stream all the output back to your local\ncomputer.\nTry doing one of these things next.\n### Change the code and run again\nFor instance, change the `print` statement in the function `f`.\nYou can see that the latest code is always run.\nModal's goal is to make running code in the cloud feel like you're\nrunning code locally. You don't need to run any commands to rebuild,\npush containers, or go to a web UI to download logs.\n### Map over a larger dataset\nChange the map range from 20 to some large number. You can see that\nModal will create and run more containers in parallel.\nThe function `f` is obviously silly and doesn't do much, but you could\nimagine something more significant, like:\n* Training a machine learning model\n* Transcoding media\n* Backtesting a trading algorithm.\nModal lets you parallelize that operation trivially by running hundreds or\nthousands of containers in the cloud.\n"}

(I'm sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV. It's not. It's clich\u00e9d and uninspiring.) While US viewers might like emotion and character development, sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf. Star Trek). It may treat important issues, yet not as a serious philosophy. It's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish, just missing a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to watch. The makers of Earth KNOW it's rubbish as they have to always say \"Gene Roddenberry's Earth...\" otherwise people would not continue watching. Roddenberry's ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull, cheap, poorly edited (watching it without advert breaks really brings this home) trudging Trabant of a show lumbers into space.

The culprits turn out to be ex-military, lead by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, otherwise known as Jase from East Enders) who is using a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight off his opponents. But Jack has a more personal reason for taking him down, that draws the two men into an explosive final showdown where only one will walk away alive.<br /><br />After Until Death, Van Damme appeared to be on a high, showing he could make the best straight to video films in the action market. While that was a far more drama oriented film, with The Shepherd he has returned to the high-kicking, no brainer action that first made him famous and has sadly produced his worst film since Derailed. It's nowhere near as bad as that film, but what I said still stands.<br /><br />A dull, predictable film, with very little in the way of any exciting action. What little there is mainly consists of some limp fight scenes, trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap slo-mo/sped up effects added to them that sadly instead make them look more desperate. Being a Mexican set film, director Isaac Florentine has tried to give the film a Robert Rodriguez/Desperado sort of feel, but this only adds to the desperation.<br /><br />VD gives a particularly uninspired performance and given he's never been a Robert De Niro sort of actor, that can't be good. As the villain, Lord shouldn't expect to leave the beeb anytime soon. He gets little dialogue at the beginning as he struggles to muster an American accent but gets mysteriously better towards the end. All the supporting cast are equally bland, and do nothing to raise the films spirits at all.<br /><br />This is one shepherd that's strayed right from the flock. *\nSample prediction with positivity score 0.996307373046875:\nFirst off let me say, If you haven't enjoyed a Van Damme movie since bloodsport, you probably will not like this movie.

You can use Conda to install these libraries before `pip` installing `tensorflow`, or you\ncan use Tensorflow's official GPU base image which comes with the CUDA libraries and `tensorflow` already installed.\n```python\nimport time\nfrom modal import Image, NetworkFileSystem, Stub, wsgi_app\ndockerhub_image = Image.from_registry(\n    \"tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu\",\n).pip_install(\"protobuf==3.20.*\")\nconda_image = (\n    Image.conda()\n    .conda_install(\n        \"cudatoolkit=11.2\",\n        \"cudnn=8.1.0\",\n        \"cuda-nvcc\",\n        channels=[\"conda-forge\", \"nvidia\"],\n    )\n    .pip_install(\"tensorflow~=2.9.1\")\n)\nstub = Stub(\n    \"example-tensorflow-tutorial\",\n    image=conda_image or dockerhub_image,  # pick one and remove the other.\n)\n```\n## Logging data for Tensorboard\nWe want to run the web server for Tensorboard at the same time as we are training the Tensorflow model.\nThe easiest way to do this is to set up a shared filesystem between the training and the web server.\n```python\nstub.volume = NetworkFileSystem.new()\nlogdir = \"/tensorboard\"\n```\n## Training function\nThis is basically the same code as the official example.\nA few things are worth pointing out:\n* We set up the network file system in the arguments to `stub.function`\n* We also annotate this function with `gpu=\"any\"`\n* We put all the Tensorflow imports inside the function body.\n  This makes it a bit easier to run this example even if you don't have Tensorflow installed on you local computer.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    network_file_systems={logdir: stub.volume}, gpu=\"any\", timeout=600\n)\ndef train():\n    import pathlib\n    import tensorflow as tf\n    from tensorflow.keras import layers\n    from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n    dataset_url = \"https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz\"\n    data_dir = tf.keras.utils.get_file(\n        \"flower_photos\", origin=dataset_url, untar=True\n    )\n    data_dir = pathlib.Path(data_dir)\n    batch_size = 32\n    img_height = 180\n    img_width = 180\n    train_ds = tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory(\n        data_dir,\n        validation_split=0.2,\n        subset=\"training\",\n        seed=123,\n        image_size=(img_height, img_width),\n        batch_size=batch_size,\n    )\n    val_ds = tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory(\n        data_dir,\n        validation_split=0.2,\n        subset=\"validation\",\n        seed=123,\n        image_size=(img_height, img_width),\n        batch_size=batch_size,\n    )\n    class_names = train_ds.class_names\n    train_ds = (\n        train_ds.cache().shuffle(1000).prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)  #

{"text": "# Run OpenLLaMa on an A100 GPU\nIn this example, we run [OpenLLaMa](https://github.com/openlm-research/open_llama),\nan open-source large language model, using HuggingFace's [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)\nlibrary.\n## Setup\nFirst we import the components we need from `modal`.\n```python\nfrom modal import Image, Stub, gpu, method\n```\n## Define a container image\nTo take advantage of Modal's blazing fast cold-start times, we'll need to download our model weights\ninside our container image.\nTo do this, we have to define a function that loads both the model and tokenizer using\n[from_pretrained](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained).\nSince HuggingFace stores this model into a local cache, when Modal snapshots the image after running this function,\nthe model weights will be saved and available for use when the container starts up next time.\n```python\nBASE_MODEL = \"openlm-research/open_llama_7b\"\ndef download_models():\n    from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer\n    LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(BASE_MODEL)\n    LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained(BASE_MODEL)\n```\nNow, we define our image. We'll use the `debian-slim` base image, and install the dependencies we need\nusing [`pip_install`](/docs/reference/modal.Image#pip_install). At the end, we'll use\n[`run_function`](/docs/guide/custom-container#running-a-function-as-a-build-step-beta) to run the\nfunction defined above as part of the image build.\n```python\nimage = (\n    # Python 3.11+ not yet supported for torch.compile\n    Image.debian_slim(python_version=\"3.10\")\n    .pip_install(\n        \"accelerate~=0.18.0\",\n        \"transformers~=4.28.1\",\n        \"torch~=2.0.0\",\n        \"sentencepiece~=0.1.97\",\n    )\n    .run_function(download_models)\n)\n```\nLet's instantiate and name our [Stub](/docs/guide/apps).\n```python\nstub = Stub(name=\"example-open-llama\", image=image)\n```\n## The model class\nNext, we write the model code. We want Modal to load the model into memory just once every time a container starts up,\nso we use [class syntax](/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) and the `__enter__` method.\nWithin the [@stub.cls](/docs/reference/modal.Stub#cls) decorator, we use the [gpu parameter](/docs/guide/gpu)\nto specify that we want to run our function on an [A100 GPU with 20 GB of VRAM](/pricing).\nThe rest is just using the [generate](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationMixin.generate) function\nfrom the `transformers` library. Refer to the documentation for more parameters and tuning.\n```python\n@stub.cls(gpu=gpu.A100(memory=20))\nclass OpenLlamaModel:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        import torch\n        from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer\n        self.tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained(BASE_MODEL)\n        model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n            BASE_MODEL,\n            torch_dtype=torch.float16,\n            device_map=\"auto\",\n        )\n        self.tokenizer.bos_token_id = 1\n        model.eval()\n        self.model = torch.compile(model)\n        self.device = \"cuda\"\n    @method()\n    def generate(\n        self,\n        input,\n        max_new_tokens=128,\n        **kwargs,\n    ):\n        import torch\n        from transformers import GenerationConfig\n        inputs = self.tokenizer(input, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n        input_ids = inputs[\"input_ids\"].to(self.device)\n        generation_config = GenerationConfig(**kwargs)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            generation_output = self.model.generate(\n                input_ids=input_ids,\n                generation_config=generation_config,\n                return_dict_in_generate=True,\n                output_scores=True,\n                max_new_tokens=max_new_tokens,\n            )\n        s = generation_output.sequences[0]\n        output = self.tokenizer.decode(s)\n        print(f\"\\033[96m{input}\\033[0m\")\n        print(output.split(input)[1].strip())\n```\n## Run the model\nFinally, we define a [`local_entrypoint`](/docs/guide/apps#entrypoints-for-ephemeral-apps) to call our remote function\nsequentially for a list of inputs. You can run this locally with `modal run openllama.py`.\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef main():\n    inputs = [\n        \"Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:\",\n    ]\n    model = OpenLlamaModel()\n    for input in inputs:\n        model.generate.remote(\n            input,\n            top_p=0.75,\n            top_k=40,\n            num_beams=1,\n            temperature=0.1,\n            do_sample=True,\n        )\n```\n## Next steps\nThe above is a simple example of how to run a basic model. Note that OpenLLaMa has not been fine-tuned on an instruction-following dataset,\nso the results aren't amazing out of the box. Refer to [DoppelBot, our Slack fine-tuning demo](https://github.com/modal-labs/doppel-bot) for how\nyou could use OpenLLaMa to perform a more useful downstream task.\nIf you're looking for useful responses out-of-the-box like ChatGPT, you could try Vicuna-13B, which is larger and has been instruction-tuned.\nHowever, note that this model is not permissively licensed due to the dataset it was trained on. Refer to our [LLM voice chat](/docs/guide/llm-voice-chat)\npost for how to build a complete voice chat app using Vicuna, or go straight to the [file](https://github.com/modal-labs/quillman/blob/main/src/llm_vicuna.py)\nif you want to run it by itself.\n"}

{"text": "\n# Stable Diffusion XL 1.0\nThis example is similar to the [Stable Diffusion CLI](/docs/guide/ex/stable_diffusion_cli)\nexample, but it generates images from the larger XL 1.0 model. Specifically, it runs the\nfirst set of steps with the base model, followed by the refiner model.\n[Try out the live demo here!](https://modal-labs--stable-diffusion-xl-app.modal.run/) The first\ngeneration may include a cold-start, which takes around 20 seconds. The inference speed depends on the GPU\nand step count (for reference, an A100 runs 40 steps in 8 seconds).\n## Basic setup\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom modal import Image, Mount, Stub, asgi_app, gpu, method\n```\n## Define a container image\nTo take advantage of Modal's blazing fast cold-start times, we'll need to download our model weights\ninside our container image with a download function. We ignore binaries, ONNX weights and 32-bit weights.\nTip: avoid using global variables in this function to ensure the download step detects model changes and\ntriggers a rebuild.\n```python\ndef download_models():\n    from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\n    ignore = [\"*.bin\", \"*.onnx_data\", \"*/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors\"]\n    snapshot_download(\n        \"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0\", ignore_patterns=ignore\n    )\n    snapshot_download(\n        \"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0\", ignore_patterns=ignore\n    )\nimage = (\n    Image.debian_slim()\n    .apt_install(\n        \"libglib2.0-0\", \"libsm6\", \"libxrender1\", \"libxext6\", \"ffmpeg\", \"libgl1\"\n    )\n    .pip_install(\n        \"diffusers~=0.19\",\n        \"invisible_watermark~=0.1\",\n        \"transformers~=4.31\",\n        \"accelerate~=0.21\",\n        \"safetensors~=0.3\",\n    )\n    .run_function(download_models)\n)\nstub = Stub(\"stable-diffusion-xl\", image=image)\n```\n## Load model and run inference\nThe container lifecycle [`__enter__` function](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions#container-lifecycle-beta)\nloads the model at startup. Then, we evaluate it in the `run_inference` function.\nTo avoid excessive cold-starts, we set the idle timeout to 240 seconds, meaning once a GPU has loaded the model it will stay\nonline for 4 minutes before spinning down.

{"text": "# Run Falcon-40B with AutoGPTQ\nIn this example, we run a quantized 4-bit version of Falcon-40B, the first open-source large language\nmodel of its size, using HuggingFace's [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)\nlibrary and [AutoGPTQ](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ).\nDue to the current limitations of the library, the inference speed is a little under 1 token/second and the\ncold start time on Modal is around 25s.\nFor faster inference at the expense of a slower cold start, check out\n[Running Falcon-40B with `bitsandbytes` quantization](/docs/guide/ex/falcon_bitsandbytes). You can also\nrun a smaller, 7-billion-parameter model with the [OpenLLaMa example](/docs/guide/ex/openllama).\n## Setup\nFirst we import the components we need from `modal`.\n```python\nfrom modal import Image, Stub, gpu, method, web_endpoint\n```\n## Define a container image\nTo take advantage of Modal's blazing fast cold-start times, we download model weights\ninto a folder inside our container image.

We'll use the `debian-slim` base image, and install the dependencies we need\nusing [`pip_install`](/docs/reference/modal.Image#pip_install). At the end, we'll use\n[`run_function`](/docs/guide/custom-container#running-a-function-as-a-build-step-beta) to run the\nfunction defined above as part of the image build.\n```python\nimage = (\n    Image.debian_slim(python_version=\"3.10\")\n    .apt_install(\"git\")\n    .pip_install(\n        \"auto-gptq @ git+https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ.git@b5db750c00e5f3f195382068433a3408ec3e8f3c\",\n        \"einops==0.6.1\",\n        \"hf-transfer~=0.1\",\n        \"huggingface_hub==0.14.1\",\n        \"transformers @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git@f49a3453caa6fe606bb31c571423f72264152fce\",\n    )\n    # Use huggingface's hi-perf hf-transfer library to download this large model.\n    .env({\"HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER\": \"1\"})\n    .run_function(download_model)\n)\n```\nLet's instantiate and name our [Stub](/docs/guide/apps).\n```python\nstub = Stub(name=\"example-falcon-gptq\", image=image)\n```\n## The model class\nNext, we write the model code. We want Modal to load the model into memory just once every time a container starts up,\nso we use [class syntax](/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) and the `__enter__` method.\nWithin the [@stub.cls](/docs/reference/modal.Stub#cls) decorator, we use the [gpu parameter](/docs/guide/gpu)\nto specify that we want to run our function on an [A100 GPU](/pricing). We also allow each call 10 mintues to complete,\nand request the runner to stay live for 5 minutes after its last request.\nThe rest is just using the `transformers` library to run the model. Refer to the\n[documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.29.1/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationMixin.generate)\nfor more parameters and tuning.\nNote that we need to create a separate thread to call the `generate` function because we need to\nyield the text back from the streamer in the main thread. This is an idiosyncrasy with streaming in `transformers`.\n```python\n@stub.cls(gpu=gpu.A100(), timeout=60 * 10, container_idle_timeout=60 * 5)\nclass Falcon40BGPTQ:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        from auto_gptq import AutoGPTQForCausalLM\n        from transformers import AutoTokenizer\n        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\n            IMAGE_MODEL_DIR, use_fast=True\n        )\n        print(\"Loaded tokenizer.\")\n        self.model = AutoGPTQForCausalLM.from_quantized(\n            IMAGE_MODEL_DIR,\n            trust_remote_code=True,\n            use_safetensors=True,\n            device_map=\"auto\",\n            use_triton=False,\n            strict=False,\n        )\n        print(\"Loaded model.\")\n    @method()\n    def generate(self, prompt: str):\n        from threading import Thread\n        from transformers import TextIteratorStreamer\n        inputs = self.tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n        streamer = TextIteratorStreamer(\n            self.tokenizer, skip_special_tokens=True\n        )\n        generation_kwargs = dict(\n            inputs=inputs.input_ids.cuda(),\n            attention_mask=inputs.attention_mask,\n            temperature=0.1,\n            max_new_tokens=512,\n            streamer=streamer,\n        )\n        # Run generation on separate thread to enable response streaming.\n        thread = Thread(target=self.model.generate, kwargs=generation_kwargs)\n        thread.start()\n        for new_text in streamer:\n            yield new_text\n        thread.join()\n```\n## Run the model\nWe define a [`local_entrypoint`](/docs/guide/apps#entrypoints-for-ephemeral-apps) to call our remote function\nsequentially for a list of inputs. You can run this locally with `modal run -q falcon_gptq.py`. The `-q` flag\nenables streaming to work in the terminal output.\n```python\nprompt_template = (\n    \"A chat between a curious human user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant give a helpful, detailed, and accurate answer to the user's question.\"\n    \"\\n\\nUser:\\n{}\\n\\nAssistant:\\n\"\n)\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef cli():\n    question = \"What are the main differences between Python and JavaScript programming languages?\"\n    model = Falcon40BGPTQ()\n    for text in model.generate.remote_gen(prompt_template.format(question)):\n        print(text, end=\"\", flush=True)\n```\n## Serve the model\nFinally, we can serve the model from a web endpoint with `modal deploy falcon_gptq.py`.

{"text": "\n# Document OCR job queue\nThis tutorial shows you how to use Modal as an infinitely scalable job queue\nthat can service async tasks from a web app. For the purpose of this tutorial,\nwe've also built a [React + FastAPI web app on Modal](/docs/guide/ex/doc_ocr_webapp)\nthat works together with it, but note that you don't need a web app running on Modal\nto use this pattern. You can submit async tasks to Modal from any Python\napplication (for example, a regular Django app running on Kubernetes).\nOur job queue will handle a single task: running OCR transcription for images.\nWe'll make use of a pre-trained Document Understanding model using the\n[donut](https://github.com/clovaai/donut) package to accomplish this. Try\nit out for yourself [here](https://modal-labs-example-doc-ocr-webapp-wrapper.modal.run/).\n![receipt parser frontend](./receipt_parser_frontend_2.jpg)\n## Define a Stub\nLet's first import `modal` and define a [`Stub`](/docs/reference/modal.Stub). Later, we'll use the name provided\nfor our `Stub` to find it from our web app, and submit tasks to it.\n```python\nimport urllib.request\nimport modal\nstub = modal.Stub(\"example-doc-ocr-jobs\")\n```\n## Model cache\n`donut` downloads the weights for pre-trained models to a local directory, if those weights don't already exist.\nTo decrease start-up time, we want this download to happen just once, even across separate function invocations.\nTo accomplish this, we use the [`Image.run_function`](/docs/reference/modal.Image#run_function) method, which allows\nus to run some code at image build time to save the model weights into the image.\n```python\nCACHE_PATH = \"/root/model_cache\"\nMODEL_NAME = \"naver-clova-ix/donut-base-finetuned-cord-v2\"\ndef download_model_weights() -> None:\n    from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\n    snapshot_download(repo_id=MODEL_NAME, cache_dir=CACHE_PATH)\nimage = (\n    modal.Image.debian_slim()\n    .pip_install(\n        \"donut-python==1.0.7\",\n        \"huggingface-hub==0.16.4\",\n        \"transformers==4.21.3\",\n        \"timm==0.5.4\",\n    )\n    .run_function(download_model_weights)\n)\n```\n## Handler function\nNow let's define our handler function. Using the [@stub.function()](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Stub#function)\ndecorator, we set up a Modal [Function](/docs/reference/modal.Function) that uses GPUs,\nruns on a [custom container image](/docs/guide/custom-container),\nand automatically [retries](/docs/guide/retries#function-retries) failures up to 3 times.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    gpu=\"any\",\n    image=image,\n    retries=3,\n)\ndef parse_receipt(image: bytes):\n    import io\n    import torch\n    from donut import DonutModel\n    from PIL import Image\n    # Use donut fine-tuned on an OCR dataset.\n    task_prompt = \"<s_cord-v2>\"\n    pretrained_model = DonutModel.from_pretrained(\n        MODEL_NAME,\n        cache_dir=CACHE_PATH,\n    )\n    # Initialize model.\n    pretrained_model.half()\n    device = torch.device(\"cuda\")\n    pretrained_model.to(device)\n    # Run inference.\n    input_img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image))\n    output = pretrained_model.inference(image=input_img, prompt=task_prompt)[\n        \"predictions\"\n    ][0]\n    print(\"Result: \", output)\n    return output\n```\n## Deploy\nNow that we have a function, we can publish it by deploying the app:\n```shell\nmodal deploy doc_ocr_jobs.py\n```\nOnce it's published, we can [look up](/docs/guide/trigger-deployed-functions) this function from another\nPython process and submit tasks to it:\n```python\nfn = modal.Function.lookup(\"example-doc-ocr-jobs\", \"parse_receipt\")\nfn.spawn(my_image)\n```\nModal will auto-scale to handle all the tasks queued, and\nthen scale back down to 0 when there's no work left.

Then head to Modal and create a [Secret](https://modal.com/docs/guide/secrets) called `nytimes`.\nCreate an environment variable called `NYTIMES_API_KEY` with your API key.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    secret=modal.Secret.from_name(\"nytimes\"), image=stub[\"scraping_image\"]\n)\ndef latest_science_stories(n_stories: int = 5) -> List[NYArticle]:\n    # query api for latest science articles\n    params = {\n        \"api-key\": os.environ[\"NYTIMES_API_KEY\"],\n    }\n    nyt_api_url = \"https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/science.json\"\n    response = requests.get(nyt_api_url, params=params)\n    # extract data from articles and return list of NYArticle objects\n    results = response.json()\n    reject_urls = {\"null\", \"\", None}\n    articles = [\n        NYArticle(\n            title=u[\"title\"],\n            image_url=u.get(\"multimedia\")[0][\"url\"]\n            if u.get(\"multimedia\")\n            else \"\",\n            url=u.get(\"url\"),\n        )\n        for u in results[\"results\"]\n        if u.get(\"url\") not in reject_urls\n    ]\n    # select only a handful of articles; this usually returns 25 articles\n    articles = articles[:n_stories]\n    print(f\"Retrieved {len(articles)} from the NYT Top Stories API\")\n    return articles\n```\nThe NYT API only gives us article URLs but it doesn't include the article text. We'll get the article URLs\nfrom the API then scrape each URL for the article body.

We use `huggingface`'s Pegasus tokenizer and model implementation to\ngenerate a summary of the model. You can learn more about Pegasus does in the [HuggingFace\ndocumentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/pegasus). Use `gpu=\"any\"` to speed-up inference.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    image=stub[\"deep_learning_image\"],\n    gpu=False,\n    memory=4096,\n)\ndef summarize_article(text: str) -> str:\n    print(f\"Summarizing text with {len(text)} characters.\")\n    # `local_files_only` is set to `True` because we expect to read the model\n    # files saved in the image.\n    model, tokenizer = fetch_model(local_files_only=True)\n    # summarize text\n    batch = tokenizer(\n        [text], truncation=True, padding=\"longest\", return_tensors=\"pt\"\n    ).to(\"cpu\")\n    translated = model.generate(**batch)\n    summary = tokenizer.batch_decode(translated, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\n    return summary\n```\n## Create a Scheduled Function\nPut everything together and schedule it to run every day. You can also use `modal.Cron` for a\nmore advanced scheduling interface.\n```python\n@stub.function(schedule=modal.Period(days=1))\ndef trigger():\n    articles = latest_science_stories.remote()\n    # parallelize article scraping\n    for i, text in enumerate(scrape_nyc_article.map([a.url for a in articles])):\n        articles[i].text = text\n    # parallelize summarization\n    for i, summary in enumerate(\n        summarize_article.map([a.text for a in articles if len(a.text) > 0])\n    ):\n        articles[i].summary = summary\n    # show all summaries in the terminal\n    for article in articles:\n        print(f'Summary of \"{article.title}\" => {article.summary}')\n```\nCreate a new Modal scheduled function with:\n```shell\nmodal deploy --name news_summarizer news_summarizer.py\n```\nYou can also run this entire Modal app in debugging mode before.\ncall it with `modal run news_summarizer.py`\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef main():\n    trigger.remote()\n```\nAnd that's it.

\"csse_covid_19_data\" / \"csse_covid_19_daily_reports\"\n    )\n    daily_reports = list(reports_path.glob(\"*.csv\"))\n    for filepath in daily_reports:\n        yield from load_report(filepath)\ndef load_report(filepath):\n    import csv\n    mm, dd, yyyy = filepath.stem.split(\"-\")\n    with filepath.open() as fp:\n        for row in csv.DictReader(fp):\n            province_or_state = (\n                row.get(\"\\ufeffProvince/State\")\n                or row.get(\"Province/State\")\n                or row.get(\"Province_State\")\n                or None\n            )\n            country_or_region = row.get(\"Country_Region\") or row.get(\n                \"Country/Region\"\n            )\n            yield {\n                \"day\": f\"{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}\",\n                \"country_or_region\": country_or_region.strip()\n                if country_or_region\n                else None,\n                \"province_or_state\": province_or_state.strip()\n                if province_or_state\n                else None,\n                \"confirmed\": int(float(row[\"Confirmed\"] or 0)),\n                \"deaths\": int(float(row[\"Deaths\"] or 0)),\n                \"recovered\": int(float(row[\"Recovered\"] or 0)),\n                \"active\": int(row[\"Active\"]) if row.get(\"Active\") else None,\n                \"last_update\": row.get(\"Last Update\")\n                or row.get(\"Last_Update\")\n                or None,\n            }\n```\n## Inserting into SQLite\nWith the CSV processing out of the way, we're ready to create an SQLite DB and feed data into it.\nImportantly, the `prep_db` function mounts the same network file system used by `download_dataset()`, and\nrows are batch inserted with progress logged after each batch, as the full COVID-19 has millions\nof rows and does take some time to be fully inserted.\nA more sophisticated implementation would only load new data instead of performing a full refresh,\nbut for this example things are kept simple.\n```python\ndef chunks(it, size):\n    import itertools\n    return iter(lambda: tuple(itertools.islice(it, size)), ())\n@stub.function(\n    image=datasette_image,\n    network_file_systems={CACHE_DIR: volume},\n    timeout=900,\n)\ndef prep_db():\n    import sqlite_utils\n    from flufl.lock import Lock\n    print(\"Loading daily reports...\")\n    records = load_daily_reports()\n    with Lock(\n        LOCK_FILE,\n        lifetime=timedelta(minutes=2),\n        default_timeout=timedelta(hours=1),\n    ) as lck, tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as tmp:\n        db = sqlite_utils.Database(tmp.name)\n        table = db[\"johns_hopkins_csse_daily_reports\"]\n        batch_size = 100_000\n        for i, batch in enumerate(chunks(records, size=batch_size)):\n            truncate = True if i == 0 else False\n            table.insert_all(batch, batch_size=batch_size, truncate=truncate)\n            lck.refresh()\n            print(f\"Inserted {len(batch)} rows into DB.\")\n        table.create_index([\"day\"], if_not_exists=True)\n        table.create_index([\"province_or_state\"], if_not_exists=True)\n        table.create_index([\"country_or_region\"], if_not_exists=True)\n        print(\"Syncing DB with network volume.\")\n        DB_PATH.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n        shutil.copyfile(tmp.name, DB_PATH)\n```\n## Keeping fresh\nJohns Hopkins commits new data to the dataset repository every day, so we\nsetup a [scheduled](/docs/guide/cron) Modal function to run automatically once every 24 hours.\n```python\n@stub.function(schedule=Period(hours=24), timeout=1000)\ndef refresh_db():\n    print(f\"Running scheduled refresh at {datetime.now()}\")\n    download_dataset.remote(cache=False)\n    prep_db.remote()\n```\n## Webhook\nHooking up the SQLite database to a Modal webhook is as simple as it gets.\nThe Modal `@stub.asgi_app` decorator wraps a few lines of code: one `import` and a few\nlines to instantiate the `Datasette` instance and return a reference to its ASGI app object.\n```python\n@stub.function(\n    image=datasette_image,\n    network_file_systems={CACHE_DIR: volume},\n)\n@asgi_app()\ndef app():\n    from datasette.app import Datasette\n    ds = Datasette(files=[DB_PATH])\n    asyncio.run(ds.invoke_startup())\n    return ds.app()\n```\n## Publishing to the web\nRun this script using `modal run covid_datasette.py` and it will create the database.\nYou can run this script using `modal serve covid_datasette.py` and it will create a\nshort-lived web URL that exists until you terminate the script.\nWhen publishing the interactive Datasette app you'll want to create a persistent URL.\nThis is achieved by deploying the script with `modal deploy covid_datasette.py`.\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef run():\n    print(\"Downloading COVID-19 dataset...\")\n    download_dataset.remote()\n    print(\"Prepping SQLite DB...\")\n    prep_db.remote()\n```\nYou can go explore the data over at

{"text": "\n# Run Falcon-40B with bitsandbytes\nIn this example, we download the full-precision weights of the Falcon-40B LLM but load it in 4-bit using\nTim Dettmer's [`bitsandbytes`](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes) library. This enables it to fit\ninto a single GPU (A100 40GB).\nDue to the current limitations of the library, the inference speed is a little over 2 tokens/second and due\nto the sheer size of the model, the cold start time on Modal is around 2 minutes.\nFor faster cold start at the expense of inference speed, check out\n[Running Falcon-40B with AutoGPTQ](/docs/guide/ex/falcon_gptq).\n## Setup\nFirst we import the components we need from `modal`.\n```python\nfrom modal import Image, Stub, gpu, method, web_endpoint\n```\nSpec for an image where falcon-40b-instruct is cached locally\n```python\ndef download_falcon_40b():\n    from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\n    model_name = \"tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct\"\n    snapshot_download(model_name)\nimage = (\n    Image.micromamba()\n    .micromamba_install(\n        \"cudatoolkit=11.7\",\n        \"cudnn=8.1.0\",\n        \"cuda-nvcc\",\n        \"scipy\",\n        channels=[\"conda-forge\", \"nvidia\"],\n    )\n    .apt_install(\"git\")\n    .pip_install(\n        \"bitsandbytes==0.39.0\",\n        \"bitsandbytes-cuda117==0.26.0.post2\",\n        \"peft @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/peft.git\",\n        \"transformers @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\",\n        \"accelerate @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate.git\",\n        \"hf-transfer~=0.1\",\n        \"torch==2.0.0\",\n        \"torchvision==0.15.1\",\n        \"sentencepiece==0.1.97\",\n        \"huggingface_hub==0.14.1\",\n        \"einops==0.6.1\",\n    )\n    # Use huggingface's hi-perf hf-transfer library to download this large model.\n    .env({\"HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER\": \"1\"})\n    .run_function(download_falcon_40b)\n)\nstub = Stub(image=image, name=\"example-falcon-bnb\")\n```\n## The model class\nNext, we write the model code. We want Modal to load the model into memory just once every time a container starts up,\nso we use [class syntax](/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) and the __enter__` method.\nWithin the [@stub.cls](/docs/reference/modal.Stub#cls) decorator, we use the [gpu parameter](/docs/guide/gpu)\nto specify that we want to run our function on an [A100 GPU](/pricing). We also allow each call 10 mintues to complete,\nand request the runner to stay live for 5 minutes after its last request.\nWe load the model in 4-bit using the `bitsandbytes` library.\nThe rest is just using the [pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines)\nabstraction from the `transformers` library.

You can run this locally with `modal run -q falcon_bitsandbytes.py`. The `-q` flag\nenables streaming to work in the terminal output.\n```python\nprompt_template = (\n    \"A chat between a curious human user and an artificial intelligence assistant.

We also time this. Note that the first time we run this,\nit will build the image. This might take 1-2 min. When we run this subsequent times, the image\nis already build, and it will run much much faster.\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    t0 = time.time()\n    with stub.run():\n        t = fit.remote()\n        print(\"Function time spent:\", t)\n    print(\"Full time spent:\", time.time() - t0)\n```\n"}

{"text": "# Fast inference with vLLM (Llama 2 13B)\nIn this example, we show how to run basic inference, using [`vLLM`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)\nto take advantage of PagedAttention, which speeds up sequential inferences with optimized key-value caching.\n`vLLM` also supports a use case as a FastAPI server which we will explore in a future guide. This example\nwalks through setting up an environment that works with `vLLM ` for basic inference.\nWe are running the Llama 2 13B model here, and you can expect 30 second cold starts and well over 100 tokens/second.\nThe larger the batch of prompts, the higher the throughput. For example, with the 60 prompts below,\nwe can produce 24k tokens in 39 seconds, which is around 600 tokens/second.\nTo run\n[any of the other supported models](https://vllm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/supported_models.html),\nsimply replace the model name in the download step. You may also need to enable `trust_remote_code` for MPT models (see comment below)..\n## Setup\nFirst we import the components we need from `modal`.\n```python\nimport os\nfrom modal import Image, Secret, Stub, method\n```\n## Define a container image\nWe want to create a Modal image which has the model weights pre-saved to a directory. The benefit of this\nis that the container no longer has to re-download the model from Huggingface - instead, it will take\nadvantage of Modal's internal filesystem for faster cold starts.\n### Download the weights\nSince the weights are gated on HuggingFace, we must request access in two places:\n- on the [model card page](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf)\n- accept the license [on the Meta website](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/).\nNext, [create a HuggingFace access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).\nTo access the token in a Modal function, we can create a secret on the [secrets page](https://modal.com/secrets).\nNow the token will be available via the environment variable named `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`. Functions that inject this secret will have access to the environment variable.\nWe can download the model to a particular directory using the HuggingFace utility function `snapshot_download`.\nTip: avoid using global variables in this function. Changes to code outside this function will not be detected and the download step will not re-run.\n```python\ndef download_model_to_folder():\n    from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download\n    snapshot_download(\n        \"meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf\",\n        local_dir=\"/model\",\n        token=os.environ[\"HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN\"],\n    )\nMODEL_DIR = \"/model\"\n```\n### Image definition\nWe\u2019ll start from a Dockerhub image recommended by `vLLM`, upgrade the older\nversion of `torch` to a new one specifically built for CUDA 11.8. Next, we install `vLLM` from source to get the latest updates.\nFinally, we\u2019ll use run_function to run the function defined above to ensure the weights of the model\nare saved within the container image.\n```python\nimage = (\n    Image.from_registry(\"nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.12-py3\")\n    .pip_install(\n        \"torch==2.0.1\", index_url=\"https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118\"\n    )\n    # Pinned to 08/15/2023\n    .pip_install(\n        \"vllm @ git+https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.git@805de738f618f8b47ab0d450423d23db1e636fa2\",\n        \"typing-extensions==4.5.0\",  # >=4.6 causes typing issues\n    )\n    # Use the barebones hf-transfer package for maximum download speeds.

We specify a [schedule](/docs/guide/cron) in the function decorator, which\nmeans that our function will run automatically at the given interval.\n```python\n@stub.function(image=requests_image)\ndef search_hackernews():\n    import requests\n    url = \"http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search\"\n    threshold = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=WINDOW_SIZE_DAYS)\n    params = {\n        \"query\": QUERY,\n        \"numericFilters\": f\"created_at_i>{threshold.timestamp()}\",\n    }\n    response = requests.get(url, params).json()\n    urls = [item[\"url\"] for item in response[\"hits\"] if item[\"url\"]]\n    print(f\"Query returned {len(urls)} items.\")\n    for _ in post_to_slack.map(urls):\n        pass\n```\n## Test running\nWe can now test run our scheduled function as follows: `modal run hackernews_alerts.py::stub.search_hackernews`\n## Defining the schedule and deploying\nLet's define a function that will be called by Modal every day\n```python\n@stub.function(schedule=modal.Period(days=1))\ndef run_daily():\n    search_hackernews.remote()\n```\nIn order to deploy this as a persistent cron job, you can run `modal deploy hackernews_alerts.py`,\nOnce the job is deployed, visit the [apps page](/apps) page to see\nits execution history, logs and other stats.\n"}

{"text": "\n# Stable Diffusion CLI\nThis example shows Stable Diffusion 1.5 with a number of optimizations\nthat makes it run faster on Modal. The example takes about 10s to cold start\nand about 1.0s per image generated.\nTo use the new XL 1.0 model, see the example posted [here](/docs/guide/ex/stable_diffusion_xl).\nFor instance, here are 9 images produced by the prompt\n`An 1600s oil painting of the New York City skyline`\n![stable diffusion slackbot](./stable_diffusion_montage.png)\nThere is also a [Stable Diffusion Slack bot example](/docs/guide/ex/stable_diffusion_slackbot)\nwhich does not have all the optimizations, but shows how you can set up a Slack command to\ntrigger Stable Diffusion.\n## Optimizations used in this example\nAs mentioned, we use a few optimizations to run this faster:\n* Use [run_function](/docs/reference/modal.Image#run_function) to download the model while building the container image\n* Use a [container lifecycle method](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) to initialize the model on container startup\n* Use A10G GPUs\n* Use 16 bit floating point math\n## Basic setup\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\nimport io\nimport time\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom modal import Image, Stub, method\n```\nAll Modal programs need a [`Stub`](/docs/reference/modal.Stub) \u2014 an object that acts as a recipe for\nthe application. Let's give it a friendly name.\n```python\nstub = Stub(\"stable-diffusion-cli\")\n```\n## Model dependencies\nYour model will be running remotely inside a container. We will be installing\nall the model dependencies in the next step. We will also be \"baking the model\"\ninto the image by running a Python function as a part of building the image.\nThis lets us start containers much faster, since all the data that's needed is\nalready inside the image.\n```python\nmodel_id = \"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\"\ncache_path = \"/vol/cache\"\ndef download_models():\n    import diffusers\n    import torch\n    # Download scheduler configuration.

This\ncan be a huge optimization when you're calling a function multiple times,\nsince Modal reuses the same containers when possible.\nThe way to implement this is to turn the Modal function into a method on a\nclass that also implement the Python context manager interface, meaning it\nhas the `__enter__` method (the `__exit__` method is optional).\nWe have also have applied a few model optimizations to make the model run\nfaster. On an A10G, the model takes about 6.5s to load into memory, and then\n1.6s per generation on average. On a T4, it takes 13s to load and 3.7s per\ngeneration. Other optimizations are also available [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/fp16#memory-and-speed).\nThis is our Modal function. The function runs through the `StableDiffusionPipeline` pipeline.\nIt sends the PIL image back to our CLI where we save the resulting image in a local file.\n```python\n@stub.cls(gpu=\"A10G\")\nclass StableDiffusion:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        import diffusers\n        import torch\n        torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True\n        scheduler = diffusers.DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_pretrained(\n            cache_path,\n            subfolder=\"scheduler\",\n            solver_order=2,\n            prediction_type=\"epsilon\",\n            thresholding=False,\n            algorithm_type=\"dpmsolver++\",\n            solver_type=\"midpoint\",\n            denoise_final=True,  # important if steps are <= 10\n            low_cpu_mem_usage=True,\n            device_map=\"auto\",\n        )\n        self.pipe = diffusers.StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n            cache_path,\n            scheduler=scheduler,\n            low_cpu_mem_usage=True,\n            device_map=\"auto\",\n        )\n        self.pipe.enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention()\n    @method()\n    def run_inference(\n        self, prompt: str, steps: int = 20, batch_size: int = 4\n    ) -> list[bytes]:\n        import torch\n        with torch.inference_mode():\n            with torch.autocast(\"cuda\"):\n                images = self.pipe(\n                    [prompt] * batch_size,\n                    num_inference_steps=steps,\n                    guidance_scale=7.0,\n                ).images\n        # Convert to PNG bytes\n        image_output = []\n        for image in images:\n            with io.BytesIO() as buf:\n                image.save(buf, format=\"PNG\")\n                image_output.append(buf.getvalue())\n        return image_output\n```\nThis is the command we'll use to generate images. It takes a `prompt`,\n`samples` (the number of images you want to generate), `steps` which\nconfigures the number of inference steps the model will make, and `batch_size`\nwhich determines how many images to generate for a given prompt.\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef entrypoint(\n    prompt: str, samples: int = 5, steps: int = 10, batch_size: int = 1\n):\n    print(\n        f\"prompt => {prompt}, steps => {steps}, samples => {samples}, batch_size => {batch_size}\"\n    )\n    dir = Path(\"/tmp/stable-diffusion\")\n    if not dir.exists():\n        dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)\n    sd = StableDiffusion()\n    for i in range(samples):\n        t0 = time.time()\n        images = sd.run_inference.remote(prompt, steps, batch_size)\n        total_time = time.time() - t0\n        print(\n            f\"Sample {i} took {total_time:.3f}s ({(total_time)/len(images):.3f}s / image).\"\n        )\n        for j, image_bytes in enumerate(images):\n            output_path = dir / f\"output_{j}_{i}.png\"\n            print(f\"Saving it to {output_path}\")\n            with open(output_path, \"wb\") as f:\n                f.write(image_bytes)\n```\nAnd this is our entrypoint; where the CLI is invoked.

All calls\nto Modal functions should be made within the scope of this context\nmanager, and they will correspond to the current app.\nSee the documentation for the [`App`](modal.App) class for more details.\n## registered_functions\n```python\n@property\ndef registered_functions(self) -> Dict[str, _Function]:\n```\nAll modal.Function objects registered on the stub.\n## registered_entrypoints\n```python\n@property\ndef registered_entrypoints(self) -> Dict[str, _LocalEntrypoint]:\n```\nAll local CLI entrypoints registered on the stub.\n## registered_web_endpoints\n```python\n@property\ndef registered_web_endpoints(self) -> List[str]:\n```\nNames of web endpoint (ie. webhook) functions registered on the stub.\n## local_entrypoint\n```python\ndef local_entrypoint(self, name: Optional[str] = None) -> Callable[[Callable[..., Any]], None]:\n```\nDecorate a function to be used as a CLI entrypoint for a Modal App.\nThese functions can be used to define code that runs locally to set up the app,\nand act as an entrypoint to start Modal functions from. Note that regular\nModal functions can also be used as CLI entrypoints, but unlike `local_entrypoint`,\nthose functions are executed remotely directly.\n**Example**\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef main():\n    some_modal_function.call()\n```\nYou can call the function using `modal run` directly from the CLI:\n```shell\nmodal run stub_module.py\n```\nNote that an explicit [`stub.run()`](/docs/reference/modal.Stub#run) is not needed, as an\n[app](/docs/guide/apps) is automatically created for you.\n**Multiple Entrypoints**\nIf you have multiple `local_entrypoint` functions, you can qualify the name of your stub and function:\n```shell\nmodal run stub_module.py::stub.some_other_function\n```\n**Parsing Arguments**\nIf your entrypoint function take arguments with primitive types, `modal run` automatically parses them as\nCLI options. For example, the following function can be called with `modal run stub_module.py --foo 1 --bar \"hello\"`:\n```python\n@stub.local_entrypoint()\ndef main(foo: int, bar: str):\n    some_modal_function.call(foo, bar)\n```\nCurrently, `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `datetime.datetime` are supported.

{"text": "# modal.config\nModal intentionally keeps configurability to a minimum.\nThe main configuration options are the API tokens: the token id and the token secret.\nThese can be configured in two ways:\n1. By running the ``modal token set`` command.\n   This writes the tokens to ``.modal.toml`` file in your home directory.\n2. By setting the environment variables ``MODAL_TOKEN_ID`` and ``MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET``.\n   This takes precedence over the previous method.\n.modal.toml\n---------------\nThe ``.modal.toml`` file is generally stored in your home directory.\nIt should look like this::\n```toml\n[default]\ntoken_id = \"ak-12345...\"\ntoken_secret = \"as-12345...\"\n```\nYou can create this file manually, or you can run the ``modal token set ...``\ncommand (see below).\nSetting tokens using the CLI\n----------------------------\nYou can set a token by running the command::\n```bash\nmodal token set \\\n  --token-id <token id> \\\n  --token-secret <token secret>\n```\nThis will write the token id and secret to ``.modal.toml``.\nIf the token id or secret is provided as the string ``-`` (a single dash),\nthen it will be read in a secret way from stdin instead.\nOther configuration options\n---------------------------\nOther possible configuration options are:\n* ``loglevel`` (in the .toml file) / ``MODAL_LOGLEVEL`` (as an env var).\n  Defaults to ``WARNING``.\n  Set this to ``DEBUG`` to see a bunch of internal output.\n* ``logs_timeout`` (in the .toml file) / ``MODAL_LOGS_TIMEOUT`` (as an env var).\n  Defaults to 10.\n  Number of seconds to wait for logs to drain when closing the session,\n  before giving up.\n* ``automount`` (in the .toml file) / ``MODAL_AUTOMOUNT`` (as an env var).\n  Defaults to True.\n  By default, Modal automatically mounts modules imported in the current scope, that\n  are deemed to be \"local\". This can be turned off by setting this to False.\n* ``server_url`` (in the .toml file) / ``MODAL_SERVER_URL`` (as an env var).\n  Defaults to ``https://api.modal.com``.\n  Not typically meant to be used.\nMeta-configuration\n------------------\nSome \"meta-options\" are set using environment variables only:\n* ``MODAL_CONFIG_PATH`` lets you override the location of the .toml file,\n  by default ``~/.modal.toml``.\n* ``MODAL_PROFILE`` lets you use multiple sections in the .toml file\n  and switch between them.

See `NetworkFileSystem.persisted` or `Dict.persisted`.\n### from_name\n```python\n@classmethod\ndef from_name(\n    cls: Type[O],\n    app_name: str,\n    tag: Optional[str] = None,\n    namespace=api_pb2.DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE_WORKSPACE,\n    environment_name: Optional[str] = None,\n) -> O:\n```\nReturns a reference to an Modal object of any type\nUseful for referring to already created/deployed objects, e.g., Secrets\n```python\nimport modal\nstub = modal.Stub()\n@stub.function(secret=modal.Secret.from_name(\"my-secret-name\"))\ndef some_function():\n    pass\n```\n### lookup\n```python\n@classmethod\ndef lookup(\n    cls: Type[O],\n    app_name: str,\n    tag: Optional[str] = None,\n    namespace=api_pb2.DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE_WORKSPACE,\n    client: Optional[_Client] = None,\n    environment_name: Optional[str] = None,\n) -> O:\n```\nGeneral purpose method to retrieve Modal objects such as functions, network file systems, and secrets.\n```python notest\nimport modal\nsquare = modal.Function.lookup(\"my-shared-app\", \"square\")\nassert square(3) == 9\nnfs = modal.NetworkFileSystem.lookup(\"my-nfs\")\nfor chunk in nfs.read_file(\"my_db_dump.csv\"):\n    ...\n```\n### from_dict\n```python\n@typechecked\n@staticmethod\ndef from_dict(\n    env_dict: Dict[\n        str, str\n    ] = {},  # dict of entries to be inserted as environment variables in functions using the secret\n    template_type=\"\",  # internal use only\n):\n```\nCreate a secret from a str-str dictionary.\nUsage:\n```python\n@stub.function(secret=modal.Secret.from_dict({\"FOO\": \"bar\"})\ndef run():\n    print(os.environ[\"FOO\"])\n```\n### from_dotenv\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef from_dotenv(path=None):\n```\nCreate secrets from a .env file automatically.\nIf no argument is provided, it will use the current working directory as the starting\npoint for finding a `.env` file. Note that it does not use the location of the module\ncalling `Secret.from_dotenv`.\nIf called with an argument, it will use that as a starting point for finding `.env` files.\nIn particular, you can call it like this:\n```python\n@stub.function(secret=modal.Secret.from_dotenv(__file__))\ndef run():\n    print(os.environ[\"USERNAME\"])  # Assumes USERNAME is defined in your .env file\n```\nThis will use the location of the script calling `modal.Secret.from_dotenv` as a\nstarting point for finding the `.env` file.\n"}

The function\nbehaves as a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) handler and should\nreturn a response object to the caller.\nEndpoints created with `@stub.web_endpoint` are meant to be simple, single\nrequest handlers and automatically have\n[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) enabled.\nFor more flexibility, use `@stub.asgi_app`.\nTo learn how to use Modal with popular web frameworks, see the\n[guide on web endpoints](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks).\nAll webhook requests have a 150s maximum request time for the HTTP request itself. However, the underlying functions can\nrun for longer and return results to the caller on completion.\nThe two `wait_for_response` modes for webhooks are as follows:\n* `wait_for_response=True` - tries to fulfill the request on the original URL, but returns a 302 redirect after ~150s to a result URL (original URL with an added `__modal_function_id=...` query parameter)\n* `wait_for_response=False` - immediately returns a 202 ACCEPTED response with a JSON payload: `{\"result_url\": \"...\"}` containing the result \"redirect\" URL from above (which in turn redirects to itself every ~150s)\n"}
